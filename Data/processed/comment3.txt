The situation is this: there's another student that I play next to in my college jazz band. He very obviously smokes weed. I don't have an issue if he wants to use weed (none of my business), but he smells terrible. It's like a skunk let of a sink bomb every time I get a whiff of him. Is there a way to nicely let him know that he smells or should I just suck it up?
If you don't wanna be mean just spring up a convo and politely mention it, I feel if you beat around the bushes he make take it as you making fun of him without directly saying it. Be direct but kind and it should work.
It's jazz. What's more jazz than that.
Black tar heroin
You‚Äôre not wrong
Ray Charles anyone?
You could make subtle comments to let him know others can smell it. He may be nose blind to the smell. Something small like ‚Äúdamn that must be some strong stuff‚Äù may be enough to let him know
Lot of people see that as a badge of honor
‚ÄúYou smell like weed‚Äù‚ÄúI also feel like weed‚Äù
somewhat condescendingly ‚ÄúGoddamn it‚Äôs loud as fuck in here‚ÄùWhen it‚Äôs dead silent in the room considering it‚Äôs a jazz class lmaoIf I was lit & heard that I‚Äôd be a little self conscious ngl üòÇ
Don‚Äôt do this, this is dumb and passive aggressive. Be an adult and bring it up directly and privately.‚ÄúHey man, I seriously don‚Äôt care if you smoke, but you smell like it often and it‚Äôs a bit of a distraction. Can you try to avoid that?‚Äù
Yea and the college kid who is showing up to class high is the epitome of a reasonable and adult person lol
That's in unfair characterization. I smoke weed almost daily and I've been more successful academic wise than many. Smoking weed doesn't make you unreasonable or immature, talking to this person directly is the best course of action
Same, but I still would go with the more casual "damn it's loud in here" or "I need the hookup you got" since it's kinda disarming and how I would probably prefer to be approached. I think we're all noseblind at a certain point, I just have to ask my wife if it's too bad haha. Probably down to personality on that front though, I definitely agree that you shouldn't treat all stoners like they're lazy teenagers with an attitude problem.
I just would want to avoid calling them out where others can hear
Oh for sure, my hypothetical was a hushed conversation between just OP and classmate while sitting in the back row of class.
True. I smoked weed every day in college too but I was reasonable enough to not come to class smelling like I just hotboxed my car
Okay? Congrats? Some people genuinely don't realize they smell like weed, they become desensitized.
Right, but the desensitization is predictable enough that you should learn to account for it.
If he does not care about smelling bad in the first place he clearly is not a very reasonable person...
He might not know, that's the reason it's best to talk up them instead of making assumptions about what they do and do not know
If one guys is smelling him then its definitely not only him and chances that no one told him beforr or that he does not smell it himself are slim.
You‚Äôd be surprised, especially now in the era of Covid, just how nose blind stoners are to that smell
I live in netherlands. I saw all sort of stoners from borderline "normal" all the way to "showering once a month if i dont hit bong first. So im pretty aware about those smells.. and usually its either or or the other.. either you can barely notice that they smoke or you know from the other side of the table.
Yeah, and no one wants to confront the guy with the ‚Äúhey man ur really smelly‚Äù spiel.The guy could be unaware, and no one has told him because everyone hates confrontation. I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so unrealistic about that. He‚Äôs in college, might be experimenting for the first time and doesn‚Äôt understand how strongly he smells to others
Lol yeah, I don‚Äôt disagree, but if he‚Äôs not going to change due to a direct confrontation he‚Äôs for sure not changing if you go ‚Äúoh my goshhh someone smells like weed üëÄ
Or maybe you could lie about being a stoner so it‚Äôs not that weird to tell him.
‚ÄúSmells like a music festival in here.‚Äù
He knows..and he doesn't care. If you say something it will most likely not change anything.
This is really how most things go in such similar situations.Tell someone about a problem they're making and ask them to do something to stop or alleviate it and then they'll either just not change it or just change for a week or two before just going back to it.
He probably doesn't have any idea how strong it smells to others.
He probably doesn't care.
He shouldn't care whether others can smell that he is smoking marijuana, since it is legal [EDIT: My error. I thought this was a sub for my undergrad college or grad school, both of which are in states where recreational marijuana has been legalized.]. He should care whether the smell of the marijuana he smokes is bothering others. He can't know whether it is unless he is told so, because some like the smell, some don't, and most don't care. The OP needs to just tell him that they find the smell distracting, just as if they were having a reaction to smelling cigarette smoke, perfume, or BO.
eh i smoke before i go into class and i‚Äôll wash my hands good and throw in some gum and throw my smoking jacket in my car.  Usually gets the smell off and i‚Äôve never had anyone say something to me but if they did i would thank them for letting me know and stop.  We are pretty reasonable people
Same here (except the class part). That's what I tend to do before going out after smoking. If someone told me I smelled really strongly I'd be surprised but I'd be thankful for the info
Adjunct here:  you'd be doing them a solid.  They don't take it well and feel attacked if its a faculty member.Why is it an issue?  Because those students are missing opportunities.  People aren't gonna vouch for someone who reeks like weed (or body odor) for jobs, internships, opportunities that come across our desk.You want to know the name you send out for a great opportunity is someone you can trust to represent you well so you keep getting more opportunities for students.The vast majority of faculty don't give a shit if you smoke weed. But they do care if you stink up the place for others  Its just a lack of common courtesy.
I smoke weed very often, and I actually like the smell of weed. But, I would want to be told if I smelled like weed when I‚Äôm out and not actively smoking - I don‚Äôt want to smell like weed. I do everything I can to prevent smelling like weed. I don‚Äôt want others to be able to tell I smoke weed unless I tell them. Some people though do take pride in it and may not care or be receptive to it.
This!!!
I don't mind the smell of weed especially fresh unburnt.But a person smelling of it after smoking is foul.  Like wwr dog plug feet plus not showered for weeks bad.
Absolutely, most people who smoke have no idea how much the odor sticks around.
I don't like the smell of weed.  But, unless I was a close friend of his, I wouldn't say anything.
As a regular user, I would appreciate it if somebody called me out if I smell like a skunk, so I could correct my hygiene routine.
Yes. Not even for his protection but for the sake of everyone who is repulsed by the smell around him.
Tbh in terms of legality and rules, if he could get in trouble by the band director or school, he probably wants to know.I‚Äôd maybe just say it smells like weed or subtly tell him
Bruh, just tell him he has bad quality weed
Bro might have some gas
Just say aye man it kinda smells. As a stoner if he reeks of weed the whole class that means it‚Äôs on him. I can smoke a blunt in my car  and walk outside for 2 mins and come in the classroom smell free, unless you smell my breath. Sounds like he needs to seal it up better
Are you sure you‚Äôre smell free? I (had) friends who would smoke weed in their car and even though I never smoked it, just being in the car with them ALWAYS made me smell like weed even though my window was always down.
Yeah completely depends on what you smoke with. You smoke any wrap with tobacco in it you will smell. I use hemp wraps and papers, the smell of actual weed in on you for less then 5 minutes if you stand outside with nothing on you ( no weed crumbles, roaches etc). I know this cuz I opened up to my coworkers one time and one or 2 are anti weed. Told em I smoke about half the timeBefore work. They were shocked. Said I always smelled like my cologne ( which I would apply before even leaving the house) changed their perspective a bit considering I was one of the best at the job
Just say these exact words: ‚Äúyou smell loud bro‚Äù
Jazz player smells like jazz cabbage, film at 11 (outta sight!)
As a weed smoker, I would say, maybe just mention it, we are nose blind, we think we‚Äôre fine if we wait 20-30 mins but we REAK! If you just let us know it could even make us feel better. Honestly the last thing I want is to smell like a skunk in a crowded room! If you just let them know maybe they‚Äôll take it into consideration and change their shirt, or put some fragrance on before getting to class.Edit: my friend mentioned to me one class that I reaked, and since then I have taken it into my hands to make sure I don‚Äôt before class, it‚Äôs not fair that I could be a distraction to other students trying to learn.
If we're calling out pot smokers for smelling like they just hotboxed their car, we also need to normalize calling out cigarette smokers for smelling like burnt dogshit.
Yes, you should let him know, and you should do it in a normal way. Since recreational marijuana is legal [EDIT: My error. I thought this was a sub for my undergrad college or grad school, both of which are in states where recreational marijuana has been legalized.] there is no reason to view this situation any differently than you would if you didn't like the smell of tobacco smoke on someone or the smell of perfume on someone or someone's body odor. If the smell is actually bothering you, the best way to be taken seriously is to just say that the smell is bothering you with no judgement on the person for smelling that way.
As much of a proponent to weed I am and how much I agree weed should be legal and free to be used by everyone. This is a problem you need to bring to your teacher honestly. You don't need to say names if it makes you uncomfortable but your right to have a clear head in class. If somone came in smelling like shit everyday somone would suggest that you say somthing to the teacher because its unhygienic and distracting. Weed is no different. The smell of weed can be distracting and pungent and it could effect your ability to think in class. This is your money, your time and your learning. Email the teacher and let her know that the smell is distracting.
I usually just announce to the whole room "wow someone just have hotboxed" and make whoever it was uncomfortable.
That‚Äôs just some dick head shit tbh.
So is coming into an academic space reeking so heavily that we all can smell it.  I hope they feel uncomfortable because they SHOULD feel uncomfortable and embarrassed by their shitty behavior.  Not everyone wants to smell weed all day.Also, I'm a TA and do this.  Not even a classmate.  So hopefully whoever it is feels doubly uncomfortable.  The professor knows who it is too btw
You‚Äôre a shit head TA then. Some people just don‚Äôt know. You say that shit to the person who forgot their deodorant that morning too? Or the ones who had a gym class before hand and couldn‚Äôt shower all the way? Not condoning smelling like it but there‚Äôs a much more mature way to tell someone they smell like something. Next time I smell alcohol on someone‚Äôs breath I‚Äôll just yell ‚ÄúMAN SOMEONE WENT HARD LAST NIGHT.
Nope.  Just to people who do shit before class that inhibits their ability to learn.  If you don't like me, write it on your course eval.  Since I only TA for my own PI he will look at it, laugh, and tell me great job
Typically egotistical TA behavior who thinks there above the world. I used to smoke with my one of TAs on the weekends at kickbacks. I‚Äôm now her manager at our job. No disrespect, just happened to move up Before her. But yeah, ‚ÄúmAkEs yOu lOoK stUPiD‚ÄùüíÄ. And nah, not really attacked, your just weird that you get a kick out of ‚Äúembarrassing people who do stuff to inhibit there learning abilities‚Äù I mean I can only play a guitar, but if dude is in a jazz class playing whatever while high, don‚Äôt think their learning is inhibited much. But you wouldn‚Äôt know, you probably follow the weed bad and makes you eat Doritos and mtn dew logic.
I don't give a fuck who smokes weed and doesn't.  My PI smokes weed every weekend.  He doesn't come in stoned.  Knowing the time and place is a skill that would certainly help you professionally
weed helps me focus on any singular tasked thing i do.  Helps keep me tuned in to a lecture when i would normally be bored out of my mind and even helps me keep my cool in an exam when i can‚Äôt figure out a complex problem.   Why is that horrible?
Nothing like smoking a bowl and busting out a weeks worth of assignments!
ahahaha nah fr that was last night for me
Sure it does
What's your problem? People self-medicate when actual medication doesn't work or isn't available. Grow up, honestly
Anyway, since you feel personally attacked by this, maybe stop getting high before class.  Makes you look stupid
because they SHOULD feel uncomfortable and embarrassed by their shitty behavior.What exactly about their behavior is shitty?Would you say the same thing about someone with body odor or a baby with a dirty diaper?"WOW! It smells like shit in here! Did someone forget to wipe their ass??"
Yes. Its rude to come to class smelling pungent. You would get fired from a real job over hygiene.
Hahaha, you have clearly never worked in tech
Dawg all I ever worked in was tech
Really? I've worked in tech since the early 90s. I've seen and had to deal way too often with other people's hygiene issues and never saw anyone fired. You? (Obviously experiences can be different, but I'm betting most tech people will have had experiences closer to mine)
Last time i tried the person in question said they shower and i must be very sensitive to smells. Or that weed does not smell bad anyway, so no problem there... not all people are the same of course, but if he does not try to get rid of it, he probably does not see a problem in the first place and wont go out of his way..
They know it smells
I‚Äôd let him know. 2-3 weeks ago at the beginning of one of my classes the department head for this class walked in and said it smelled like weed in the front row and pulled a couple of the people out. one of them hasn‚Äôt come back to class since
Would you make the same comment if the person isn‚Äôt using deodorant?
Sorry, but I'm assuming that situation would be worse. I've seen people complain about how other people need deodorant all the time. Some people straight up don't have the patience and avoid the person. Like please.
Yes. I've seen people fired over poor hygiene in the work force. Smell is distracting and people deserve a right to not have to filter out B.O. or the smell of weed. I'm not joking when I say I have no sympathy and will tell a professor if a person came into class with a pungent smell. Its distracting and rude to the people around you.
OP would be doing the student a huge favor by telling them if they were stinking because of no deodorant.Some people really either just weren't taught hygiene properly at home, or get into some weird idea that "I don't smell because of my diet." But they stink, and it will affect their life.
Jazz and marijuana simply don‚Äôt mix. I would likely tell the instructor immediately to have him removed.
Cringe
Guess how I know you know nothing about jazz.
Louis Armstrong literally smoked weed? Harry Anslinger and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics attacked Billie Holiday and she got sent to jail because he associated cannabis with jazz. What makes you think you know everything huh?
Jesus Christ it‚Äôs fucking sarcasm.
I‚Äôm autistic you fuckhead
I‚Äôd literally do not give a shit.
Cringe
Almost as cringe as having sex with your tampon in huh?
LolI posted it? Why do I care if it‚Äôs out there? Again, ur cringe
Xdd
I‚Äôm sure he knows and doesn‚Äôt care but you could just mention on a day he smells really bad  it smells like weed in here with a scrunched up nose. He‚Äôll probably just laugh but it‚Äôs worth a shot
I mean tobacco doesn‚Äôt smell great either, it really doesn‚Äôt now that I‚Äôve quit smoking ‚Äî everyone here knows that ‚Äî but when I began college in 2002 my university didn‚Äôt go non smoking until about the time I graduated in 2008 and I didn‚Äôt quit smoking tobacco around then either so fact is everyone was huddled up outside the building smoking cigarettes ‚Äî I know vapes didn‚Äôt exist then, but tobacco reek was overwhelmingly common twenty years ago and now marijuana is legal here ‚Äî you can‚Äôt smoke it ON CAMPUS but the question is do people have a right to smoke it in their car and come in smelling like it like they did tobacco 20 years ago?
Tell him to stop bringing his stinky roaches to the room and that he stinks up the whole room
The problem isn‚Äôt that he brings Weed to the class. Is that he brings half smoked roaches. THAT‚ÄôS the stinky smell.
Usually the people that smoke the most weed don‚Äôt particularly care (which is why they‚Äôre generally awful people)
Suck it up. If you tell him, he's going to either think you're asking for a hook-up or he'll tell you that he doesn't care.
Unfortunately pot heads are (almost always) impossible to get through
tell him to air out before yall play
Hy guys
‚ÄúIs it loud in here?l
He knows bud üòÇ
im sure if he doesn‚Äôt know and he thinks he‚Äôs covering it up well, he wouldn‚Äôt mind u telling him. If he knows and doesn‚Äôt care, sorry :(
Just my two cents here but I have a mate who's never smoked it in his life and sometimes when he's a little sweaty later in the day, he smells of it, but maybe just have a quick chat with him and let him know quietly one on one
My man is just trying their best to emulate some cab calloway! In my jazz ensemble I would be functionally enlightened occasionally. Letting him know he smells like grass probably isn't a bad thing but go about it in a non confrontational way. Just be like "hey man/girl just letting you know you smell like herb".Any self respecting musician will try to mask it in a collegiate setting, especially if there are any hornshttps://youtu.be/svoSSdsNhtA?si=-YEDDGxgmkRg3dDD
hit em with one of these
I am pretty sure he knows and just doesn't care. I mean he is a college kid that plays jazz. If I was you, I think I would ask him to talk to you after class. And just tell him, listen man, I don't care about weed, but the smell is distracting for everyone. Could you please tone it down a bit. Just try to be cool about it, and understanding.
People like you are why jazz sucks now, no offense. Learn the history of the art form
Yes if they are in a place where it is illegal be a g pass the axe givem a nod they know. Lol no seriously let some one know they smell don't be an a jerk but let em know.
I would tell him politely.
I would‚Äôve been appreciative if you let me know. Can‚Äôt speak for him though..
Realistically, whatever you say will not get them to stop smoking weed, so I'm not sure it will have any effect if you say something tbh
Just tell him that he smells like weed. It‚Äôs extremely off putting‚Ä¶
Tell him. I don‚Äôt care how you do it tell him because it‚Äôs not right for else to smell his stinkiest
He just wants to be jazzed up for Jazz
He likely knows but doesn‚Äôt care
Tell him he smells like shit. Potheads are the type to think ‚Äúeveryone else must enjoy the smell too‚Äù so you need to be blunt sometimes.
‚ÄúYou loud bruh‚Äù
"Dude, you reek of weed"It could seem like you're trying to protect him from getting in trouble.
just try to be chill about it‚Äînothing wrong with weed, but it‚Äôs kinda a bad move to make everyone deal with the smell. still, totally possible he‚Äôs nose blind and doesn‚Äôt realize.‚Äúdamn man you smell like straight gas,‚Äù ‚Äúdude you smell like a skunk,‚Äù ‚Äúyou smell like you just got back from a music festival‚Äù. big part of it is tone, just try not to call him out in front of everyone and be friendly-ish about it?realistically, he could totally get in trouble for it. obviously he should look out for himself better, but you don‚Äôt lose anything by letting him know, and you might just gain a fresher smelling classroom.
reeks of weedjazz bandas a fellow jazz cat. he knows.
Just do it kindly at the end of a practice.
Yes. Im a stoner and i appreciate it when people tell me that cus it can be hard to notice. Thats just me anyway.
Slip him a note.  Then you can really be honest
It‚Äôs literally NONE of your business. Leave it alone and mine your business. You have no idea why someone is choosing to cope with substance. So instead of telling him the obvious (because I‚Äôm sure he freaking knows) why don‚Äôt you be a good friend and see how he‚Äôs doing mentally?
I think it's ok to point it out professionally.  Remember, it could be for medical purposes.  I only have medical in my state, and I got approved.  I use edibles to remain more in the down low about being on it.  Cannibas has a very distinct smell, and for many, it's gross. Users have to respect both parties in this.
Suck it up

Switzerland is so insanely beautiful! And CLEAN!
and expensive! First trip we've ever taken where we had to be frugal with dining and take out
Omg I KNOW! I was really surprised. Going out to eat (even solo) was hard to be under $20.
It's not really worth it tbh. The food there isn't very good.
I think some of their things were just okay. I am from Spain so its hard to compare the flavor profiles üòÖ
Interestingly - we unfortunately have one of the highest estimated littering rates among OECD countries.We just evidently pay to have a very good clean-up system.
First time visiting Europe we went to Switzerland after visiting Italy and tour guide said Switzerland hoovered the streets every night.
Really! Thats very interesting. I was in Zurich and saw never any trash on ground or in the city buses etc. Thats so interesting!
Zurich is the only city ive ever seen with a clean city river. Ive been to most major cities in Europe
Totally! You really feel in a first world country.

There are a LOT of migrants in Switzerland
but cleanliness is so nice ...lacking in North America these days..:(
I agree. I've found many many parts of Mexico to be much much cleaner than most parts of the US. Some of the small towns in the US are still clean, but that's quickly being erroded.
same here in Canada more litter lately everywhere:( would like to shout at everyone please keep it clean it does not take much
???????????????? 30% of Switzerland is migrant and incredibly culturally diverse. Check that weird bullshit at the door.https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/population/migration-integration/by-migration-status.html#:~:text=Key%20figures%20on%20persons%20aged%2015%20and%20over&text=In%202022%2C%2040%25%20of%20the,(1%2C115%2C000)%20has%20Swiss%20nationality.
Good renders. It would be such a great country if it was real.
Good rendering isn't cheap ...
My favorite. Murren and Lauterbrunnen valley. Could just sit and stare at the scenery for days.
Right? It‚Äôs breathtaking!
wow. Question for you. I'm traveling to Switzerland from America next month.  I haven't figured out how to navigate around the country with money. Should I just accept whatever fees are associated when using my debit/credit card? my friend says TWINT is the popular electronic pay app amongst groups, but as an American I will not have accept to use this app. I saw another post that said not to travel with cash so now I'm not sure what do do. I have venmo, paypal prepaid cards i could use as well. Any advice is appreciated. thank you!
Get a credit card without international fees. Most places take cards, I usually hit up an atm once for a couple hundred euros upon arrival. I leave half in the room safe when I go out so as not to have a lot of cash on me. That way I only pay the fee once.
Swiss here, use wise or Revolut, pay everything with the card, there won‚Äôt be any fee. Take out 200.- from the free withdrawal amount so you have cash in case of need. But everything can be purchased with a debit card. We mostly stopped using cash and almost everything can be paid contactless. Even the cheese I bought in a farm near me was paid contactless.
This! I always use Revolut, no fees and everything went smooth.
Thank you!!!
Ideally have a credit card with no foreign transaction fees and just use that. Venmo doesn't work abroad and TWINT I'm pretty sure you need a local bank account (and phone number) to sign up for. Just use your card, and in worse case, withdraw some cash. But almost everyone will take card now - especially post-COVID.
Cashapp & Coinbase cards charge no International POS fees. They also allow you to add money easily on the phone app, and can be added to Apple Pay. When using them and having the option at the cashier to choose USD or EUR, always choose EUR. You get a better exchange rate through the card.
There‚Äôs only one shop I use cash at which is the local kebab place that doesn‚Äôt have a card reader for whatever reasonDebit cards/Apple Pay is accepted literally everywhere.TWINT is what we use to send money to each other. I don‚Äôt see a reason why you should get it as a tourist, especially because you can only use the prepaid version. However unlike your debit card/Apple Pay, you can also use it at small farm shops (but some are starting to have card readers)
Twint is for Swiss numbers and a few European countries. https://www.twint.ch/en/faq/can-i-use-twint-prepaid-with-a-non-swiss-mobile-phone-number/#
Yes but you will have to buy the TWINT top up vouchers at a shop to use it
As others have said, just use a credit card that has no foreign transaction fees. When you pay by card, you will see the choice of USD for dollars or CHF for Swiss francs. Always choose CHF, otherwise you get an up charge for currency conversion and the exchange rate is garbage.
Which cities did you visit? Looks awesome.
Geneva, Montreux, Vevey and Leysin
How did you get around?  Car rental?
I have a family member with a car living there. But I would guess that would be the best option as public transport, although very good, is really expensive.
The train system is fast, clean, easy, on time, goes everywhere and includes busses and trams, intercity and regional trains. It's cheap when you get the half fare travel card (good for one month/only for tourists), which costs 120chf, but if you take public transportation everywhere is worth it. Much cheaper than a rental car plus parking. Did all my travel planning, tickets, routes on the SBB app. Super easy. Go with public transport.
Went there earlier this year and loved it! I can't wait to go back to the Jungfrau region. We ended our vacation in Luzern and mountains looked like they were painted onto the sky, absolutely beautiful!
I want to go to that region so bad, maybe next time. But the views are amazing all around the country.
When I was visiting Zurich for work, one of my Swiss colleagues jokingly said "Why would you want to visit Luzern? It just another city on a lake with a view of the mountains. Stay in Zurich." The country is beautiful and has some incredible scenery no matter where you go. Your pictures really capture a lot of that storybook charm.
Thank you!
We did go to Zurich for a morning before we did the Lindt factory tour and we didn't really see the appeal. Maybe it was the time of day but there wasn't much to do. Luzern felt like it had more of a charm, easier to walk around, beautiful views, etc.
I could see that for a first short visit. Right around the main station is a lot if banking/business and luxury shopping. If you venture across the river to the old town or closer to the lake, there's a lot more to experience.
Leysin, Montreux, Vevey? That's where I live :).
Correct!
I took a train from Zurich to Milan. Unbelievable experience
Thank you for making me look at these pictures. That alone robbed me from about a 1000‚Ç¨. All jokes aside SUI is a place where my soul relaxes. It is so fucking gorgeous.
Ahah, definitely not cheap!
I was just there twice this last year. I went to Bern, Basil, Th√ºn, Naters, Sempach and a couple of other places. I was chasing family history from the 13th century and military history.
Beautiful
Really nice place.
This makes Vermont look like child's play.Damn. That Autumn is LIT.
Magical land!
Beautiful! Thanks for sharing!
My best friend lives in Switzerland. We visited two years ago in November for her bday and the colors on the trees were amazing the country is seriously beautiful all year round.
Such gorgeous photos!
Thank you!
Absolutely beautiful! ! ! ! ! !
Amazing view!
Even the teeny sliver I saw of Zurich during my layover had me blown away.
The Swiss have a certain pride in their country, which is difficult to replicate anywhere else. They spend regionally and export internationally, which has helped them maintain a a high value economy. I had the pleasure of living there in the '90s and miss the place terribly.
thanks for sharing
Amazing place. Just really expensive
I stayed in Switzerland in 2017. Most beautiful place - I would go back! The bath tubs were SO deep, swans were all over lake Lucerne, and the chocolate and cheese was amazing. BEST of all was the air. Going from a small town in ETX to the most beautiful, breathable air I've ever inhaled was unforgettable. Made me want to live there no matter the cost.
It looks beautiful. I think the extremes in daylight hours would bother me but what a great vacation spot!
I went in very early June. Beautiful weather, still snow on the tops, two passes that I would have driven over wasn't opened ... it was quite cold to sleep in tent at a very but fantastic campsite above Grindelwald. The next night I had closed my tent for the wind and dressed with more wool, and then I slept like a baby. The days were fairly long. Highly recommendable
What do you mean by ‚Äúextremes in daylight hours‚Äù?
They probably mean that they confused Switzerland with Sweden?
I live at 33 degrees latitude and Switzerland is at 46 so it does make a difference but yea, Sweden is more extreme. I just live in sunny Southern California so I am kind of a wimp with dreary weather and shorter days.
I've lived in socal too:) given the latitude maybe in the same place, so I understand where you are coming from.Switzerland is usually just not considered to have extremes in daylight hours, and often confused with Sweden in the US. So that was my best bet. No offense intended
No problem. My sister lives in Michigan now at the same latitude approximately as Switzerland and it was a tough adjustment. I just think I would rather visit in the summer. I read about the hiking the Swiss like to do in the summer where trams can take you up or down and there are hiking trails between trams and these ‚Äúhuts‚Äù that serve hearty lunches halfway through the trail (they take less than a day between each stop).
That makes sense, was just curious since I haven't heard the daylight hours described as extreme, but I can definitely see that coming from socal! I was thinking that due to the mountains casting shadows, it can also feel like less daylight depending on how deep in the mountains you are staying.
My idea or extreme likely has to do with how long I have lived in a low latitude and how little I have traveled above this latitude. But certainly 46 degrees is really not extreme.
Looks amazing. How long did you stay for and what was your budget?
I stayed for 3 full days. I spent around 150‚Ç¨ but that‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt pay for accommodation as I have a family member living there, and most of the meals were home made, transport was always by car, etc‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs a pricey country.
Did you take some huge dumps over there?
Yep. Switzerland Rules!!!
Beautiful photos! What are some of the must see areas during the winter months?
I think in the winter a trip to a mountain is a must. I think all mountains have views like the ones in the photos, with the snow and the little log cabins. That specific town in the photos is Leysin.
I loved Zermatt. Did you go there? The town was beautiful and extremely clean
Not yet, but I would love to go! Maybe next time.
how much lighter did your wallet get?
Ahah! A little, as I have family living there. Otherwise would be a lot üòÖ
you take good photo
Thank you!
For make a trip here, what is the budget ? ‚ò∫Ô∏è I live in France and I never have the opportunity to go here ü•π
It really depends on how many days, where you go, etc‚Ä¶ but Switzerland is an expensive country because the wages are high. For reference an expresso coffee is always around 3,50 or 4chf, which is a lot. Public transport is also very expensive, so plan carefully before going.
A lot, I paid 30‚Ç¨ for a pizza a 0,5beer and a espresso. Was not even a special fancy place.
That is where Frankenstein was from.
When I see this shit, I realize I take traveling for granted sometimes

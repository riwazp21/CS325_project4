Is this a forklift obstacle course or something?

Why is there so much crap all over the floor??

Do you see how they are working? These guys are high af or something. Got a huge empty warehouse like that and still hitting pallets on the ground and shit

This is a conference Center somewhere during load out. These guys are often worked stupid hours and mostly alone. Safety is rarely a priority. I swear they all operate the same way in spite of being different cities, countries, planets whatever.
Event over = don‚Äôt care basically.

You know that makes a lot more sense. I‚Äôve worked conventions like that too so I shoulda guessed lol.

Left over event shwag and props and whatever from a trade show sort of thing. They don‚Äôt want to take most of it home.
The boxes that fell over are probably just flyers or something. Valuables don‚Äôt get left on the floor like that.

Klaus died to allow this shit to happen.

It was only his first day on the job though!

This guy forklifts

Someone explain what happened?

Im outside the camera view he was watching me move another pallet and got distracted and went over a metal plate

Clean your shit fight of a warehouse up

Yes but why does the irrelevant dude so all that? And whats the metal plate and why did he back to it

I have even more questions, whats laying on that metal plate, and why is there such a mess or is it really an obstacle course?

It's where they manufacture forklift certified chads, of course.

That is a plate that goes into an airplane. You put pallets on top of that plate. And the mess you see on top of that plate are the ropes to tighten the pallets to the plate.

Is this a training thing or what?

This was a lot more upbeat than I was expecting given the post title.

Exactly. ‚ÄúForklift,‚Äù ‚Äúmistake,‚Äù and ‚Äúdying‚Äù should not be in the same header for a video that‚Äôs supposed to be funny.

The guy who dropped the pallet load made a dumb but fairly innocuous mistake. 
His buddy driving with no seat belt, hopping out of a moving forklift, is the real jackass here.

Glad I wasn't the only one who thought this
Happy Cakeday!

Forklifts have seatbelts??

Yes. Forklifts are kind of like cars in that you are safest inside of them. They are designed so that if the load falls, you are in a protective cage.
The seatbelt is handy if it‚Äôs overloaded and the forklift begins to tip over, you don‚Äôt fall out and then get crushed.

Exactly this! Which they should know if have required OSHA training and forklift license.

Knowing and doing are completely different things. You have to have an employer that enforces policy, or it will be ignored for convenience.

RIGHT! Unfortunately, careless actions are why there are well over 100 deaths, in the U.S. alone, by forklifts. All could have been prevented by simply following the rules and obeying safety training. A lot of the time just by simply wearing the seatbelt.

Since Klaus was already mentioned in this thread, ill add the link to this...

Some newer ones do but not all of them.

If they didn't and your forklift tipped. You would be dead.

There is a German educational videos for teaching forklift driver.

You won't need a translation. You will get the meaning by the explicit content .

this one comes with subtitles

One of the funniest things I've ever seen I think. Wow

We have a subreddit dedicated to german humor. /r/germanhumour

Thanks!

There is also an amazing song about forklifts

Those pallets are wrapped like crap too, no wonder it dumped so easy.

Yeah it was already tipping before they even hit anything

I am so glad this title was misleading! I had to check the subreddit name twice as it has been happening to me lately to wander of in the abyss of reddit.

as a fellow forkie, i have done this and many other worse things.  
how have i not been fired yet i dont know

If we fired everyone who ever misjudged load balance, we wouldn't have any forkies left.

I honestly thought someone would die.

Not the video I though I was gonna see

Jesus the mess around there

Lol I thought the guy he fell on the ground got impaled by something given the title. Then noticed which subreddit this is lmao

I the warehouse i work at had this much open space, i would be so happy. The fact theres so much random crap all over the floor is just annoying.

Meh, he didn‚Äôt even get it stuck in a door or similar. 
And yeah, one guy at my workplace did that.......3 times.

I worked on a stand up forklift for 5 years. Had several coworkers through the years that literally got their lifts hung on the huge door that went into perishables. The door(curtain) wouldn't be up all the way yet and they'd come flying through and get the top of the lift wrapped lol.

Well, this is certainly on the milder end of what I pictured when I read "forklift" and "driver dying" in the same sentence

Are you even forklift certified bro???

Someone asking for becoming roadkill, cant blame him for laughing though:D

I was real fucking confused until I saw what sub this was on

I thought this video was going to be a lot darker than it is, until i saw what board it was posted in

What kind of mickey mouse operation is this? Why is there trash everywhere? And most of all, look where you're going!

Meanwhile at UPS....

I‚Äôve been to jail so many times, forklift simulator

Hopped out like he was never buckled in which from my understanding is a huge no-no.

I thought that man had a heart attack

Mi primera chamba üé∂üéµ

Melbourne market?

Safety man is going to have some questions why giggles over there wasn‚Äôt wearing a seat belt or why he jumped out of the forklift while still in gear

I would be fired if I operated a forklift like either one of you. 
Yeah let me hop out of the moving forklift, which means I did not set the parking brake nor did I have a seatbelt on to over exaggerate a ‚Äúlaugh‚Äù. Totally not a liability.

Just another day at DHL

dying laughing...not dying.

Forkie here reporting in. It happens to all of us

This isn't funny at all. This is a fucking gong show of a warehouse.

I read the title and thought someone is dying

Dude did a real life ROFLMAO

y‚Äôall run a messy ass warehouse. clean up your shit. someone will get hurt.

This is so fuckin fake.. from this obstacle course to the fake ROFL of this second idiot.

this gives me a lot of joy

If that happened at my work, you would be off the machine, and an investigation would be done, and you wouldn't get back on until it was done, and management had a talk with you.

Including remedial training

Yes, and this. People seem to forget that these machines will kill you and think nothing of it.

Insurance scam attempt? Or just you guys being buddies and making jokes? And how did you get security to let you make a cell phone video of the footage? That looks like a ton of space unused for an Amazon facility.... I'm calling B...s#!t.

He was distracted by something off camera and went over the metal plate

The whole time, this song is going through my head:  https://youtu.be/WS-tXEIgWBY?si=1K0dB2R2FVUVk5VT

Fork lift driver hurts knees screams and falls at others mistake

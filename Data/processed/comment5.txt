I see gill movement as well but there is a chance that its mental capacity is shunted. Alive is subjective.
I knew I was not trippy. And if it was dead-dead, won't it degrade and detach from the fish?
There a difference between brain dead and simply dead
Okay I‚Äôm never asking a question in this sub again. So what if I didn‚Äôt know fish had brains. Quit downvoting me
Yes, fish have brains. Diagram of fish anatomy here.
But colossal squids do not have a brain? Why is thatEdit: wrong they do.
All squids have brains. They look a bit different than our own, but they are fully functional nerve centers. Why'd you think they don't?
I was googling the anatomy of other ocean life. I knew if I posted in the comments asking if squid‚Äôs have brains someone would be like WHY DONT YOU GOOGLE IT yourself. So I looked it up quick. Anyway that‚Äôs cool
Octopi actually have 9 brains.
Very cool
Invertebrates like squids tend to have nervous systems that are dispersed throughout the body. Vertebrates with their neat internal neuron cages can afford to have specialised organs like brains
Very cool

Fish have been around for a long time, somewhere around 500 million years, they might be a bit more intelligent and feeling than we give them credit for
The reason a lot of people think this I believe is that we are so far off evolutionary. We just have a difficult time reading their body language and never had reason to (not to mention how to before cameras and other equipment). So for us humans a fish's behavior seems completely irrational: we can't read its intent and wants nor predict their behavior. Also they express emotions in a totally different way making us believe they don't have feelings nor react on pain.
Yes. Small focused on basic functions but they do
Thank you kindly for the info. They sure are tiny
I upvoted you, so please stay. FYI, I didn't understand how complex the fish brain is until I searched for it just now, so your previous doubts are completely understandable.
Thank you
Why do you care about being downvoted? Who gives a shit.
Turns out your friend here is mostly dead. See, mostly dead is still slightly alive.
Have fun storming the castle!
And if it was dead-dead, won't it degrade and detach from the fish?It would start rotting and may kill the fish.  That's a common silver arowana.  Osteoglossum bicirrhosum.
It scored poorly on the SATs.
The eyes are reactive and the gills are moving. No clue how you'd assess its intelligence in relation to a normal fish of this species, but at the very least it appears the other brain is functioning.
It would be amazing if the main head benefits from it. Like, the vision from the other head and the extra gills for added respiration.
It's not one entity experiencing things through two sets of eyes, this would be two distinct creatures with a fused nervous system. Considering it reached adulthood, the lower head can extract nutrients from the main body just fine. Presumably respirating filters through its blood no matter which head is doing it.This happens in turtles and snakes typically. There's been more study on those. Some of them share digestive tracts, so both heads can chew and swallow food, drink water and such, and both benefit from this despite being siblings from the neck up. It's funny how they often fight over food despite it not mattering which eats it.The most famous human equivalents to this are Abbie and Brittany Hensen, two conjoined twins. They share a body in a similar way and are most certainly two distinct people. This fish probably works the same way.
Well they clearly share a blodstream, so they both oxyginate the same blood. Stamina must be through the roof with this fish, although it may not be the fastest fish in the aquarium, or anywhere.   I'm pretty sure that they don't  share vision or other sensory input.
Can the main body react to what the other head sees? I'm torn between it being beneficial (stamina + vision), or detrimental (slow + demands more than the normal body of the fish) ‚Äî however, I'm leaning more towards the detrimental side as not much twin heads live in the wild.
Just the drag from that extra dangling head would be enough to cancel out any benefit.Only way this fish is alive is because it‚Äôs in captivity.
I don't think they share sensory input, so no shared vision would be my guess.  Yeah I'm pretty sure it's detrimental. It doesn't matter that you have all the stamina in the world, if you don't have enough speed to catch your prey or out run your predators.
Well, these fish dart to capture their prey.  That second head messes with that.  It's simply a second embryo that joined with a larger one.  A mistake in embryogenesis of multiple blastocysts during fetal development.
Or at least additional brain power. Kinda like adding an external ssd to your pc.
Hold a piece of shrimp meat in front of it and see if it likes the scent.
Arowana are merely eating machines.  Intelligence is not something you'd equate with them.  The second head is functioning, but doubtful that it would add to its collective IQ.  They are robotic eating machines.  Their mouth is like the door on a landing barge.  They swim, they eat, they mate.  That's it.
The silver arowana is not rare at all.  This two headed one is an example of fetus in fetu.  Two eggs combined and one took most of the nutrients or two sperm fertilized one egg at once.  This is the cause of all 3 eyed cattle and two headed cattle.  It's two embryos developing within one egg or two eggs that combine and one egg partially absorbs the other while the embryo in the absorbed egg still continues developing.Both heads are alive.
The fuck
That's his backup camera
‚ÄúWatch my back bro‚Äù
Fuck what kind of previous life did that mofosoul have before being reincarnated as just a fish head?
a sinful one üò≠
It's two blastocysts that were too close to each other and started developing into each other.  This happens when either one egg is fertilized by two sperm at once or two embryos join from two eggs where one absorbs the other and both embryos continue developing while becoming attached to each other.  One always takes more of the yolk than the other and matures faster.  My bet is on two sperm fertilizing one egg and two blastocysts developing.
Very creepy!
Have you ever played Seaman on the Dreamcast?
I never thought this could happen to a fish. I know malformations happen to animals but it never crossed my mind it could happen to a fish.

Fetus in fetu.
He asked for a little head.
Do you like fish sticks?  :)
It's was new for me, but quite mind blowing too, wow...., like how? , I mean we will get to know the theory and biology of this after research and study but looking at it simply it's very umm...UNIQUE and weird too, how it is handling 2 different visions, how it's getting visualize in brain, where it is looking at in the video?
Check my other responses.  But it has 2 brains.  One per head.
Thanks sincerely, It's insightful. So are they similar as the cases of human twins who are not separated, their nervous system might be also tangled in each other?
Nice kuato
Twice as many stars in the sky
‚ÄúWell, There‚Äôs always more fish in the sea!‚Äù‚Ä¶ the fish‚Ä¶
Very cool!
Maybe it can see out of all 4 eyes.
Parasitic twin?
There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do.

That fish must‚Äôve been born close to the Fukushima power plant. üò≥

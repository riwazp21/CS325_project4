“Matthew, it is with a heavy heart I say goodbye,” LeBlanc wrote on Instagram Tuesday. “The times we had together are honestly among the favorite times of my life. It was an honor to share the stage with you and to call you my friend. I will always smile when I think of you and I’ll never forget you. Never.“Spread your wings and fly brother you’re finally free,” he continued. “Much love. And I guess you’re keeping the 20 bucks you owe me.”Anyone searching for the full quote.Poor guy.
Agreed, how’s he going to get that 20?Jokes aside I can’t imagine how any of the cast must be feeling right now
Maybe from Lisa - she owed Matt some money:https://youtu.be/K949b7baeAE?si=ueGkG7eGsYm3mWZe&t=1m50s
Ladder to heaven
If it's anything like when I've lost colleagues, it is a stark reminder of your mortality that you cannot shake.
its probably extra hard since its once of the most syndicated if not THE most syndicated tv show, so high chance you turn on tv and there he is. but maybe celebrities dont watch tv like us common folk
Probate
Yeah. Check the probate. Why, my Uncle Thumper had a problem with HIS probate, and he had to take these big pills, and drink lots of water.

They are pretty tight knit group,I read that they all negotiate their pay together during friends and all of them have same amount of pay per episode.
I think, sad.
Damn. I lost a buddy to suicide, and he owed me an inconsequential amount of money. I still occasionally look at the spreadsheet of how we split the trip, just for the memory.
And I guess you’re keeping the 20 bucks you owe meCould he BE any more Joey.Damn, I just made myself sad.
And the instagram post.
Always bothers me when the media says something like "breaks silence" in this kind of situation as if the Friends cast somehow owes it to the general public to talk about their friend passing away.
I'm pretty sure I read something about the first comments on Matt LeBlanc Insta were people blaming him, and saying it was his fault for not being there for Matthew Perry and "allowing" him to die.It was pretty fucked up. It's no wonder he waited a little while before making a public comment.
Was there any context that I missed as to why it's Matt LeBlanc's fault? How would he "allow" Perry to die? Was he his babysitter? Was he even there? I do not understand blaming Matt LeBlanc.
Because some people think TV is real and they still live in an apartment together.
"He lives in the adjacent room! They sit next to each other every day! How could Joey let this happen?!"
I wasn't a heavy Friends watcher, but didn't LeBlanc also act as a Dr on Friends. I mean he could have saved him!
Brooke Shields was so convinced that she didn't understand why he didn't help a choking person in a restaurant. But then the inception folds & you're forced to believe that she's a crazy person that's in-love with a fictional character played by a fictional character played by a real actor.If only Matt LeBlanc would let Joey Tribbiani take over in order to let Drake Ramoray take over to save Matthew Perry from having a heart attack & then drowning...Because that's what TV is, right?
It's a dude playing a dude, playing a dude...
I seem to remember an episode where Drake Ramoray had to play a part within the show, either pretending to be someone else or had a bit part in a production of a show within Days of Our Lives...Acting-ception!
He was brought back to life via a brain transplant, so he had to act like the character in the show Jessica Lockheart (played by Susan Sarandon).
Right!Man, I'd actually watch that show. Lol. I don't even care that it would be corny, that would just make it more entertaining.
LeBlanc acted as Joey. Joey acted as a Dr.**
If only Dr Ross Geller would have helped him.
What? Joey has a house in the suburbs and chandler moved out they live nowhere close to each other
THEY WERE ON A BREAK!
Especially when he is also a doctor!!
"I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.""Oh, my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?"
And you left the toilet seat up you bastard!!!
Even if they were close friends in the real world or even roommates it's crazy. If anyone knew it knows someone with an addiction issue they know how helpless it feels to rid them of the problem but it's not as easy as saying "Hey buddy. Stop!"
I've got a niece that's 10, and my brother is 30. Last summer a doctor told him he won't live to see her graduate high-school of he hasn't stopped drinking. He hasn't stopped drinking. He's actually a lot like Joey on Friends, one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, but book smarts was never his thing and I think he's drinking because life isn't turning out like he thought it would
My dad was told he had a few years left if he didn’t quit drinking. He made it six months and died when I was 24. I don’t know what kind of relationship you have with him, but I can’t stress enough trying to get him to quit. My biggest regret is not doing the tough love approach with my dad. Maybe it wouldn’t have worked, but maybe it might’ve gotten through. For your niece’s sake, have the uncomfortable confrontation if you haven’t already.
If the duck had just been there maybe he wouldn't have drowned.
The original post didn’t happen to be by Brook Shields was it?
And Ross and Rachel are still on a break.
No way they could afford those apartments now.
Was there any context that I missed as to why it's Matt LeBlanc's fault?No, you didn't miss anything as far as I know.This is just the an amalgamation of: a bunch of psycho's that lived their friendships vicariously through these people, because they don't have their own or more likely, they abandoned their own and have become so insufferable that nobody in real life would maintain a relationship with someone that could say something so horribleedge-lord assholes that have zero social grace and have boring lives such that they need this drama and they want to twist the knife and see someone hurt because they are fucked in the headteenagers/kids that have limited concept of how these dynamics work and are perhaps even projecting their own emotional struggles out into the world, because in their own adolescent self-obsessed lives, they blame their own friends for why they may be sad. But at least this group tends to grow out of it.
I've also noticed that with streaming, kids don't seem to fully understand time. So there are probably young ones out there who don't really get that the cast have Friends has not worked together in 20 years. Like, on one level they understand this is an older show that has dates references, but on the other hand, it's a show they are actively watching for the first time so it must be contemporary (added to the fact that 90s fashion is back-- their clothes don't look out of place!) I've had more than one conversation with a middle schooler about this phenomenon...
Reading this comment gave me heart eyesEDIT: Double heart eyes bc you’re a Bad Friend
It is what it is to be associated with people who have self-destructive tendencies. There is no winning. If you intervene, you get called an enabler. If you don’t, you are the ass who fiddled while Rome burned.
Because Dr. Drake Ramoray allowed this to happen
He did say he would be there for him when the rain starts to pour.
People in a parasocial relationship with 90s sitcom characters
I mean.........if we're only considering the characters, and not the actors, Joey is the only one I'd be friends with. Ross is straight up psychopath. Monica is controlling and overbearing. Racheal is a self centered bitch. Chandler is a sarcastic asshole who exists only to make himself laugh. Go ahead and watch. None of them legitimately laugh at his jokes. There was one scene where Raechal acknowledged that Chandler couldn't think of a joke. So they KNOW he's constantly joking. They just never once laugh. Pheobe I MIGHT be friends with. Her background into crime, and living on the streets kind of puts me off though. If anything happens with her life, she already knows how to steal, when to steal, and who to steal from. We don't see her steal from the friends, but we also don't see her life totally crumble into being homeless again either. And finally Joey. His flaw is that he sleeps with women, and doesn't call them back. What we don't see is how he does it. If these women are just doing a one night stand with Dr Drake Ramore, then thats not a problem. If he's tricking them into thinking theres a marriage, or a relationship they thknk is going to happen, then thats Joeys fault for leading them on. Still though, his personality is much more pure than the other 5. He would give you his last dollar if it would help you. Joey is the best of the friends, Ross and Raechel are the worst for almost polar opposite reasons. Ross has been borderline stalking Raechal since middle school. When he finally swoops in, and "gets" her, he doesn't change his personality at all. He doesn't "become" self centered who views Raechel as his property, he's been like that since he was in 8th grade and she was in 5th. We even see a flashback when he's in college, and she's in high school but gets stool up by her high school boyfriend. So Ross's dad tells Ross to put on his dads tux, which he does just in time to see Raechel running out with her original date. The look on Ross's face says "You were supposed to be mine"Then years later when he's dating her, she's at work, can't leave, and he tries to take her away, to go on a date. He was talking to her like "c'mon, lets go", not understanding that a boyfriend isn't a boss. But Raechel since middle school has treated Ross like a 3rd option. If option 1 falls through, and option 2 doesn't pan out, THEN maybe she'll date Ross. Just keeping him wrapped around her finger. In case it pleases her later. Now, in the final episode, they're like 40 years old, and the "Cliffhanger" was "I got off the plane". As if to insinuate that they're back together. And everyone thinks this means that Raechel and Ross are going to make it last forever this time. And I gotta say.....I don't get where that assumption is coming from. They've been on again only when it benefits Raechel, and they've been off again when it stops benefiting Raechel, for over 30 years. What makes THIS time different? What's preventing Ross from doing something stupid, or Raechel from doing something selfish? If the show had kept going, I give it 6 episodes before we got round 4 of "WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!" Speaking of which, Raechel wasn't mad that Ross slept with a random girl. She was mad that it was like 3 hours later, which shows how easy it is to replace her. Meanwhile, 3 hours IS way too soon to sleep with another girl if you feel like maybe something changes with the seperated status of the woman you "love". Ross isn't mad that that were on a break. He was mad that in his mind she cheated on him with Joshua. Which means they never resolved their fight because they were fighting two different fights. Raechel was mad that Ross only viewed her as an object, and when she didn't come running when he snapped, he started accusing her of cheating. She felt Ross was hiding behind a thin disguise of being on a break that she innitiated to dispell any blame for his affair. This made her feel like he viewed her as his toy, and status symbol.Meanwhile, Ross is very insecure that everybody is going to leave him, because every wife he had he ends up getting divorced. He can feel that he says things one way, but nobody interprets it that way. He can feel how people judge him, and he feels Raechel is going to leave him for Joshua. So when he hears all of his fears are true, all bets are off, and he now sees Raechel as a manipulative person who only keeps him around until she finds something better. So he's fighting for what he feels is his importance as a person, and doesn't feel bad about the 3 hours, because Raechel told him they were on a break so (in his mind) Raechel can go sleep with Joshua guilt free. So if Raechel can sleep around guilt free because she's on a break, why wouldn't Ross be able to sleep around while they're on their break???The point is, these two characters are awful people who bring out the worst in each other. They shouldn't date. Joey and Pheobe should have dated. Joey could have been supportive of her daily life, and she could have "healed his spirit" Joey doesn't believe in astrology, but he wouldn't offend Pheobe. He'd just be like "Alright, cool. Now how about we order a pizza for me, and a salad for you?" And she'd say "and breadsticks! But not the kind with cheese." And Joey would say "What??? But those are the best ones!!!" And Pheobe would talk about how cheese is an animal product so Joey would offer to eat the cheese of hers. And thats why Joey and Pheobe are adorable together, and we got robbed.TLDR; I don't remember. I'm on chemo, and I'm smoking right now. I probably started that comment 45 minutes ago. I have no idea what it says, but I know it's awesome stuff. I'M the one who wrote it, so it HAS to be good! Or maybe I'm a narcissist who thinks everything I do is great. The chances are 50/50 there! But I'm an optimist who simultaneously chooses to believe I just have great ideas, but also that WWIII could happen literally anytime. It sort of feels like cold war 2.0 has officially began. On the bright side, The Simpsons is still on the air and criminally underrated these days. It's not going back to the glory of early seasons, but it's still a great show.
Hey man, look, I gotta catch up reading Fourth Wing.  So why don’t we say I read your novel/comment, and disagree with something out of context like a standard Reddit reply. 👍🏽
k...
It's Instagram.  There's trolly idiots on literally everything.
Because the internet has too many idiots.
Damn right the internet has way too many assholes!
THEYRE ROOMMATES
Perry had a bunch of problems irl and those people don’t understand how life works because they’re too busy being parasocial online.
Are you kidding me, that’s awful.
If I was a celebrity of any sort, I would stay off socials or at least never read comments. People are nasty for no reason.
sometimes people like these really make you think about this freedom to vote situation in a different way
That is fucked up.
Yeah most headlines now really bother me because it seems like they intentionally phrase things in a way to get a rise out of people instead of just reporting on facts.
The other thing is they weren't actually silent.The five of them released a joint statement pretty much immediately that said they were all devastated and were taking the time to grieve and would eventually speak more about him. But for now their thoughts were with the family and they requested privacy. For some reason that was not enough for some people. I don't understand why people who have no actual relationship with these people want to insert themselves into these peoples' friendship/relationship during a time when they are grieving someone who died suddenly.
This was exactly my thought as well. Why was it so important that he has to make some public statement? The world is fucking insane these days I swear.
It is insane these days, but this phrase isn't new. It's been around forever when it comes to people in the public eye. At least as long as I can think of.
Also, to me at least, "breaks silence" has a connotation of something salacious.
"you were accused, now apologize"
Unfortunately, a lot of people do seem to believe that. Social media is... very weird.
Unfortunately, people getting really weird about celebrities long pre-dates social media. They just find each other more easily this days.
With a headline using "breaks the silence", I was expecting LeBlanc to say something like Matthew Perry died during an unholy orgiastic baptism to Moloch. Not "It was an honor to call you my friend". That's not "breaking the silence" that's just the most normal thing for him to say. If he'd said nothing at all, I'd just assumed that was his sentiment. Shameless clickbait on the part of the outlet.
There was one example where someone passed away and some fans thought one of his collaborators would make a comment and they didn't and they got really weird about it. It's fine if the persons work really resonated with you but one element that I dont think a lot of people are ready to have a conversation about is the amount of celebrity worship that goes on. Some fans just get too close.
When you become a public figure, it comes with certain expectations. It’s shitty but it comes with the territory. The Friends cast in particular have made it known how close they all still are, so there is an expectation of some sort of comment.
It’s funny that this is the top comment. Because that is the exact thought I had when I read the stupid headline. Well said.
Pretty sure OP is not an actual person
As a bartender and also as a human that has lost friends, I’m just getting Anthony Jeselnik “thoughts and prayers” vibes from people like that
Oh... That last photo of the group of them from the finale.Breaks my heart. Can't imagine going through all of that together. Ten crazy years.
I know they other four will eventually make a statement, especially now that Matt has. I think people are really waiting to hear from Jennifer, since Matthew said she was the one that kept in touch with him the most over the years, and was the one that confronted him about his drinking while they were doing the show.
Courtney Cox just posted a little while ago and ugh :(
There's a link to it in OP's article. Of course they had to make a whole separate article for it to milk the page views out of it.
reading that at work was a terrible decision
Feel that.
They are not obligated to share anything with us.  Leave them alone
I had a friend go missing under freak circumstances. Her body was never recovered. During the search for her, the media were absolutely brutal. Her family asked for privacy but we (her friends) kept getting requests for statements or we'd have our SM scoured for information about her or what was happening. It was horrid. Losing her was devastating. She was the brightest, sweetest, kindest, most joyful person I've ever met. I still remember her smile and the way her eyes crinkled whenever she saw you, like she couldn't hold back how happy she was to be with you in that moment. It's been almost 15 years and I still want to talk to her sometimes. Going through that rollercoaster--hoping she'd be alive, then slowly losing that hope, then finally going through her being declared dead--was made exponentially worse and more traumatic because of the media.So, yes. Leave them alone.Edit: And a special thanks to the people speculating on why my cousin killed himself, in a public forum that his family also frequented. That was a total violation but so glad you guys got your curiosity sated.
“Breaks silence” is a sensational version of the word “said.”  Clickbait bingo.
”I guess you’re keeping the 20 bucks you owe me.”Wait. Chandler owes Joey money?Also: 😢
Sometimes you just can’t write it down. Because if you’ll do it, it will became real. It’s like you are letting this into your life. Like now, me, am writing this. So now it’s also real for me and crashing my heart to pieces.
I think this is enough articles cashing in on the actors death.
I remember in the book, Perry read the pilot to Friends and said "That's me! I'm Chandler Bing!"
There’s something about hearing from the other cast members that really makes me emotional. 😢
♪ thank you for being a friend ♪
we already know, that’s why the show is called friends
Why Was Matt LeBlanc Silent About the Death of Matthew Perry? Silence is Violence. Matthew Perry Might Be Alive Today If Matt LeBlanc Had Broken His Silence Earlier. We're Putting Matt LeBlanc On Blast
The way you use capital letters is interesting. Are you a robot? I think you're a robot
That's called title case and it is the standard for news articles in many styles. Could definitely still be a bot though.
I am aware of title case, it's just quite unusual for human posters to use this, this "person" uses it for every single post. The only comments are direct quotes from articles. I don't know why I'm getting downvoted, it is a bot
Matthew Perry lost me when he demeaned Keanu Reeves. Interesting that Matthew Perry walks among us no more.

And you lost everyone else when you posted that low IQ statement above! Go home … and stay there… never leave!
Block me. 🤣
And who’s this Keanu Reeves anyway?!!! He’s a second-rate,  artificially and self-promoted, over-rated excuse for a fake »actor » whom people like you think is worth anything because he starred in the pathetically cliche Matrix movies? Grow up dude! Reeves is nothing but an overpaid little child who has an over-blown sense of self importance based on stupid fans like you!
Matthew Perry was mean & petty. Period.
They were good together
Definitely
Which episode is the pic in the header from?
When you’re an actor, I can’t imagine that any statement on topics such as these will ever feel like it’s good enough. This one though, it’s about perfect. You can tell how much time, thought, and effort he put into it. That second “never” is what got me.
Beautiful. Tearing up 😭
Why is it always “breaks silence”? Maybe they just needed some time. 🙄

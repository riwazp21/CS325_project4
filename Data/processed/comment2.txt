He looks like he's a bit of a scientist himself.

I'm something of a baller myself

No, that skill seems to be very lackingü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

In spite of every time you have dunked on them, eventually they will hate you

Can the Basketball player come out and play?!

What about my free-throws? Did you give them a chance?!

With science, technology, and a Ph.D., he was ready for anything -- except an undersized basketball.

You know how much he's sacrificed!

Like his tailbone?

I read that in the voice of Leslie Nielson

OUT AM I!?!?

I'm immediately reminded of "Pissmaster" from Rick and Morty.

Yall ready for piss

SLUT . .SLUT DRAGON...

That basketball was like some kind of heat seeking pissile!

The science of pooping in a bag for the rest of his life.

Looked painfull and expensive. I think the basketball won.

The drones‚Äô Achilles heel has been exposed. Russia dramatically increases domestic production of basketballs.

Ukrainians already discovered they can stop Russian drones by chucking a branch at them.

Ah.. the Ewok defense.

Now why would a Wookie want to live on Endor?  It doesn't make sense!

Objection: misstatement of facts. Chewbacca never lived on Endor, nor did he visit Endor. Chewbacca was part of a rebel contingent on the forest moon of Endor to shut down the shield generator.

I think you‚Äôll find that the shield generator will remain quite operational.

Dismissed. 
Go home, OJ

Oh, you mean the most successful guerilla defense in all of ancient, ancient recorded history???

Can you imagine this stuff in ‚Äúreal combat‚Äù.  The Green goblin was defeated when, while Spider-Man was still talking to him, a bystander threw a piece of trash out of a window, sending his flying machine into a tailspin and killing him from the 3 story fall.

Wouldn't have happened if the propellers were caged.

[deleted]


a bystander threw a whole chicken


There was already a scene where a bunch of bystanders threw a bunch of junk at the Goblin. Surprisingly he didn't die from it.

"What the hell, bro?  Did you just throw a burrito out your window?!"

You destroyed the only thing I love, there it is. What do you love?

It did! Took me a second watch to notice that it took out one of the propellers when it bounced back, and that unbalanced the whole thing.
Should have put cage guards on those things...

No, that would‚Äôve been smart

...point taken

Give it back! Can't just be taking stuff.

Should have put a cage guard on it.

[{[point taken ]}]

Next you're going to say he should wear some sort of padding if he's going to lift himself 20 feet in the air and not do it over concrete.

Nah, I'm more concerned with the apparatus than the moron

yes, where will they possibly  find another nerd to pilot the next one if they break this nerd.

WOH you watched the video too?!!!!! crazy

He did! You can see how he described the events in the video, and repeated them back.
Should have put timestamps on those things

WOH you read the comment too?!!!!! crazy

I don't know how expensive! Pretty sure what you saw flying was mainly the plastic bits of the propellers. If they tried this stunt they probably also took into account that it was very likely this was going to be the result. 
On the other hand, I see little to no protection on that guy so..who knows maybe they were just dumb

He did wear a proper helmet, he has a few brain cells to protect. Just not enough to see the very obvious design flaw.

No elbow guards, wrist guards, hip guards, etc. though. Left elbow took a rough hit.

I'm not convinced they thought it through that much. Guards for the blades would seem like a cheaper option than replacing a whole set of blades and who knows what else got bent.

I would think you wear more protection with a bunch of spinning open blades under you

And give up the ability to slice the worthless peasants beneath you?

I think he meant protection as in motorcycle leathers.

I think he meant protection as in condoms.

Definitely don't want to get impregnated on the way down

This happened to my buddy Eric

Was only a matter of time

Just put cages on the top half of the propellers, leave the bottom half open.  Checkmate peasants.

Oof, yeah. I once connected with regular quadcopter blades (flight computer fried) and walked away with an ER trip and a few stitches.
I can‚Äôt put words to how hard I pucker when I see him standing over many more and harder driven blades.

when it started to get wobbly, i thought for sure his arms were going into the blades before they stopped spinning.

He had a BMX helmet from 2004, what more could he need?

pegs. dude needed pegs so he could grind a rail instead of hovering for no reason.

Oh my God I forgot about pegs. The quickest way to be seen as a badass as a kid was to put pegs on your bike.

Isn't it a motorcross helmet?

Yeah, a BMX helmet from 2004.

This guy gets it.

"We'll meet again, Spider-MaAAAHHHHH JESUS FUCK!!"

The basketball was actually thrown by an angry New Yorker, just out of frame.

You mess with Spidey, you mess with New York!!

I‚Äôm walkin here!

You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!!

What a great fucking scene at the time.

This one got me. gg

That went exactly as I expected.

That went better than I expected.

Yeah, worst case the drone goes out of control and skyrockets in altitude and he falls from 30+ feet up, and he winds up with broken legs/hip.
Absolute worst case it does an inversion and he does the same head-down, but then it wouldn't be posted on r/funny.

Another risk: If one of the rotors had connected with flesh, they're about as much fun to touch as a tablesaw.  There are plenty of images of drone rotor injuries out there if you seek them out, it's not pretty.
I guess mythbusters did a quick demo in their last season with a raw chicken
https://youtu.be/MgeRchTHxVk?t=67
The whole stunt could have easily sent someone to the ER.  If everyone walks away with bandaids and bruises, that's practically the best potential outcome

As someone that's built a lot of drones I can definitely confirm how stupidly dangerous they are. I've taken chunks out of my fingers with just small, low powered drones. One of my first memories of carbon fibre props was seeing one take a giant chunk out of a wooden desk, they scare the shit out of me.

Same here. Idiot looks like they can still move under their own power.
In my book, this is what we call a "qualified success."

Yeah, the project was an application for the Christopher Reeve memorial Chair in physical education.

Gotta admire the confidence and commitment though, like testing the water with both feet.

The basketball: "first, we attack his heart"

more like attack his coccyx! that butt bone of his is deff ruined.

Back to formula?!
Yeah okay, back to formula.

‚ÄúOUT,‚Äù AM I?!?! Ok I guess you‚Äôre right

FINISH IT!!! Please help me finish repairing my glider.

Tell me you have a lot of money without telling me you have a lot of money.

You watched the movie right? Green Goblin is loaded

Tell me you have very little common sense without telling me.

Honestly looks like someones private basketball court

Yeah, rich kids doing rich kid things

I have a lot of

"you cant stop me spider man" (ball hits drone) "wohawoh agh aw shi-"

Norman would have made the shot.

Sure, but that MF was hopped up on performance enhancers.

How did you break your $50,000 drone?

I've seen them built (they're only DIY, nobody makes these for sale) for between $3k-$5k

It's a product made by a company which looks like was started through kickstarter. This is the video where the clip is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdUDQ22-Oak in 2021.

Which has a sale price of $90,000 and as far as I can tell they only made a few for media, they haven't actually shipped anything from their Kickstarter

Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme kickstarter and the grift.

For real? What's the model?

You could build that for about 5k.

Sounds about right. It looks custom made.
I honestly respect the concept, they just didn't have safety and redundancy in mind.

What does a drone like this one cost? Genuinely interested in trying this myself. I'm a hobbyist that would like to do this lol.

I spec‚Äôd something like this out after making an electric skateboard a decade ago and you could probably get all the parts for under $2k. Especially from a chinese supplier like hobby king. 
You need a low Kv motor. Those are like $30-$100 a piece. You‚Äôll need 6 or 8. 
Then you need a few multi motor ESCs to connect everything to. Mine was like $80. 
Then a radio/controller to control everything $20-$50
Then metal for a frame to connect everything to and for standing on/hanging from. 
The biggest expense is the hospital bills from testing it out though. 
Kinda relevant: I fell on my ass making that electric skateboard‚Ä¶So I made a custom RC controller using an Arduino board. My first time messing with programming hardware. The controller had a throttle range mapped from 0-160 so neutral position would send 80 repeatedly and anything below that was brake and anything above that was excelerate. 
So guess what number is sent when the skateboard loses signal?

Guessing 0 so you lost signal and it threw you?

/u/herefromyoutube/, is blobbiesfish right?

Oh. sorry. 
Yes, zero. It stopped the board right in its tracks and I kept going.

Same, I'm interested in becoming the Hobb Goblin

The Hobbled Goblin.

If I remember correctly they made it themselves

Tom Segura trying to one up his last basketball video?

That asshole has slimmed down a lot, but no amount of drone power could lift that ego off the ground

Airplanes can barely lift him, no way a double drone could

Didn't he get fairly skinny? Last I saw he was probably close to 190

Why no guards around the blades?
Edit: yall need to stop upvoting this.  I keep getting notified and reminded I‚Äôm a snarky jerk online

Extra weight.  Normally you stay away from basketballs though.

There‚Äôs no room for that extra weight when it already gotta lift 80kg of dumbass.

80kg of dumbass is actually the same weight as 80kg of feathers

lol can't add like 10 grams of plastic?

Do you think 10 grams of plastic would have done anything?

maybe not 10g, but a small amount of plastic would be negligibly light and prevent direct contact with the propellers
if it's lifting a person, it can handle half a pound

It would have stopped a miniature basketball from hitting the blades üòÇ

It's probably enough to stop a ball bouncing into the blades. That wasn't forceful. It was just the blades hitting something, not something hitting the blades.

Could intefere with aerodynamics which is also why helicopter rotors have no guards

I think that's also because a helicopter blade might crush a basketball though

OUT, AM I?

AVENGE ME!

r/thatlookedexpensive

Why waste that opportunity playing basketball? Also surprised he didn't see that floor in the plan and stick a lightweight cage around it.

I offer you friendship, and you spat in my face!

Next prototype will have a cage around the spinning blades

He broke his back, " keep on filming..."

Yea the lack of concern from anybody is sad

"We did twenty takes, and that was the best one."

Don‚Äôt tell Harry

The Green Wobblin

Looks like Wemby in his debut tonight‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never lay up on me spider-man‚Äù

OUT AM I?! proceeds to drop explosive on glider

I thought this was /r/whywomenlivelonger

Drones can be rebuilt, spinal injuries are forever.

I see he is a candidate for the Darwin Award

The spray of little broken parts made this video for me.

Even though it failed, that was pretty cool. Add a guard to protect the propellers and make them stronger to account for the extra weight and try again.

Every time I see this reposted it makes me chuckle.

That looks like the best case scenario of what could‚Äôve happened

I‚Äôm something of a baller myself

Well, at least that's not the worst thing that's ever happened involving a basketball player and a method of flight.

Add prop guards to the next version and try  again.

There was no way that wasn‚Äôt going to end in tears‚Ä¶

Rotor guards, man.

who gave me this defective pumpkin bomb

wHy dOn't we hAve FLying CaRs YEt

Version 2.0 should include a guard for the rotors

Is there a sub for almost losing multiple limbs?

The blades could have cut him into pieces

Well that‚Äôs a kick in the paycheck ü´°

That has to be an expensive fuck around and find out  moment.

people do not have enough respect for small blades, spinning really fast

He not built for this

Maybe borders around the propellers would be a good idea

The one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying‚Ä¶

At least he wore a helmet.

Natural selection

THE FUTURE IS NOW!.... or maybe not just yet.

All and all that went about as well as it possibly could

Prop guards may have been a good idea

Im honestly astounded that thing produces enough lift to get a grown ass man off the ground

New sub! r/idiotsondrones

"We'll play again...Spiderman!"

This is what we get instead of universal healthcare

r/whywomenlivelonger

that's an expensive fuck up

That's still valuable in terms of testing.
Now you know you'll need rotor shields as well as stabilizing for rapid motion.

This is the same reason why the FAA is adding Remote ID to all drones and they will keep track of all flights ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
These pilots are a joke

His pumpkin bomb betrayed him

Should‚Äôve invested in prop guards

Someone didn't do their FOD training

If I ever get the power of flight, I'm sure as shit not wasting it on sportsball.

Do these things not fly well with rotor guards/cages?

that looked expensive

As with any multi rotor build I'll tell you that was expensive to build and fix

I just hear Cleveland going ‚ÄúNo no no no no nooo‚Äù

There goes 20 grand

Ooof, elbows are fuuuucked

Putting out your elbows like that is a terrible idea, and he wasn't wearing elbow pads, or wrist guards... easy way to break something

Smart enough to build it, stupid enough to get on it, smart enough to wear a helmet.

Why would you not have blade guards on something like this?

Ouch those elbows

Should have practiced his shot

why aren't those blades wrapped in a cage?

Because rotor guards would make you look stupid /s

I was waiting the entire time for him to fly into the basket.
8(

Stupid games with stupid prices!

I love when scientific curiosity and stupidity cross over. This should definitely be crossposted to /r/whywomenlivelonger/

Rich assholes lmao

Reminds me of those takes in the iron man movie when tony is testing out the boosters in his garage.

"I'm somewhat of a scientist myself"

"Curse you Spider-Man!!"

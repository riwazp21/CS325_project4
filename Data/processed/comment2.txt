Bergen is the capitol of Norway?
Breaking news ! I knew I messed up somewhere‚Ä¶ when I saw the annual rainfall value I put it in the list blindly lol
It is the rain capitol
capitol =/= capital
Judging by this map - that would be √Ölesund
It arguably was a long time ago, but we'd have to reach all the way back to the middle ages for that.
It‚Äôs their wet dream to be honest
üòÇ.
Bergen is the capital of the Republic Of Bergen
Neither is Bern of Switzerland.
It is though.
Switzerland has no capital.
Not De Jure, but it does have one De Facto. In fact a lot of countries doesn't have a capitol De Jure, it's pretty common. But the internet has gotten an obsession over Switzerland for some reason.
Which are? I can't think of more than the Vatican, Monaco, Nauru and Switzerland. All of them except Switzerland are tiny countries in global importance. Maybe that's why.
Vatican is huge with global importance. Even Swiss mercenaries work for Vatican.

???????
Why post this comment?
Why not?
But Bern is literally considered Switzerland's de-facto capital. If you google "capital of Switzerland," Bern shows up as the answer.
De facto means nothing. Switzerland has de jure no capital.
On the contrary, de facto means everything. It's de jure which quite literally means nothing.If all a country's government power including executive, legislative, and judicial is located and entirely enforced from one specific city, that city, by all effective means, is the capital.That's Bern.
It's still not true, what is a capital is governed by the laws of the specific country, not by which city is most important. Or is New York the capital of the USA just because it is the most important city and I am sure it has some government institutions too. Same with Istanbul, Rio or Sydney. All "de facto" capitals?
New York is not the capital because the United States has a President, a Congress and a Supreme Court, these are all in the same city, and that city is not NYC. DC is both the de facto and de jure capital.Switzerland also has a city where these organizations are concentrated, it may not have a constitutional amendment labeling it as the capital, but it remains the de facto capital.
Edinburgh also doesn't really belong on the list. It's the capital of Scotland, yes, but Scotland's not a sovereign country.
Title doesn't say "...capital of a sovereign state" just "capital", so Barcelona could have made it to the list as well, for instance.
Well in that case, Bergen is the capital of the Western Norway administrative region, so Bergen should be on the list too.
Sure, if they said "Bergen - Western Norway administrative region", like they did with "Edinburgh - Scotland".
Oh that's fair. I didn't notice the map stated what country/province the capital belonged to.
Isn't Bergen on the list?
Yeah, I was just referring to this comment chain which started with someone arguing it shouldn't be on the list because it's not the capital of Norway.
Oh right, sorry. I'm on Team Bergen, then! üòÖ
Paris and London might have an urban microclimate going on (especially Paris), that would explain them being the driest places in their respective countries.
Southeast England as a whole is generally drier than the rest of the country, its often overcast or drizzling there when everywhere else is having heavy rain.
Yeah "generally damp" isn't the same thing as lots of rain.
Some parts of east and south east England are almost semi arid due to the affects of Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor and Exmoor in the South West, the Brecon Beacons, The Malverns, The Cotswolds, The Mendips and the North Wessex Downs directly west/northwest and then The Pennines to the north. They literally catch most of the rain before it gets to the southeast which means the south east is a lot sunnier, drier and warmer than the rest of the country, followed by the east
Yeah the south east gets pretty yellow/brown by the end of summer, even without the recent "heatwaves" (in quotes as it's they are becoming normal summer temperatures).
I was thinking the exact same thing for Paris, since the city and its surroundings are usually a lot greener than parts of the south, especially near the mediterranean sea. Yet, I went online, and it seems that Paris and its surroundings are indeed a relatively dry area compared to the rest of France. The map for Edinburgh shows it well here. I guess that other parameters such as the ability of the ground to retain water or average temperatures
I‚Äôm surprised nobody has mentioned Podgorica?
Apparently, I live in one of the parts of Europe that is wetter than there.Oh well. I'll try not to drown on the evening walk.
yeah i was wondering why it rained so much there
Podgorica has always surprised me since it's basically a desert when it's not raining.
It's been raining everyday in Paris for the last 30 days so I'm not sure how Paris is dry lol
Rainfall total and number of Rains are to different things
Paris is not very rainy. In my region ( north of Portugal ) we had extremely heavy rain for almost 40 days. In just one month, some areas recorded more than 1000mm.
It's very light rain.
Paris dryer than all of Scotland had me laughing.
Same argument as "it snowed yesterday, guess climate change isn't real"
Shocker that London isn't as wet as people think it is.  To some degree it is less about volume and more about frequency. However,from experience of living in the South East, using my dog walking as a measurement, I would only get wet a handful of days each year. I imagine if East Anglia was used then only Madrid would be drier.
Cambridge is around 570 mm. Even lower are central European capitals like Warsaw, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bratislava, all of them somewhere around 530 mm.
I wanted to try a little experiment today. here's the result! I tried to emphase how cities are drier/wetter than expected and just showing precipitation data, which I always find interesting with all its tiny regional variations.More maps on my website for fellow geography enthusiasts!
I think expectations are not only formed by the absolute amount of precipitation but also by the number of days with precipitation.If it's raining, it doesn't matter that much whether it's a lot or just a little for most people's perception.
Yes exactly, it applies to the UK notoriously!
Yeah also Berlin is very dry for European standards yet in winter it seems constantly wet.
Quasi-permanent cloud cover and chilly temperatures make evaporation and evapotranspiration very low. Berlin and most of Brandenburg used to be a very marshy area too.
Love this map. Thanks üëç
I don't love this map. Rome not part of Europe?
It says several European capitals. Not ALL.
Is Bergen a capital? Would you compare that, or Bern, to Rome?
It's really cool, though I would like to see the source. From what i've looked into, the average anual precipitation in Madrid IS 435mm. Perhaps your map IS based on data for a specific year?
So, I used the data from a high resolution climate model which allows a great spatial precision. I observed a slight difference between observation and the model and I can‚Äôt really explain it. The model applies to the 1980-2010 periodAfter considering it, it could be that what is measured in station is a specific spot (mostly airports, a little outside the city) and the values I took are more centered on the city
Well interpolation is always kind of problematic when looking at climate, which can vary a lot in short distances. It so turns out that the main meteorolgical station in Madrid IS in the damn centre of the city üòÖ (specifucally in retiro park). I think your high resolution climate model might lack a few stations of note. You can probably check It manually. Edit: podgorica also seems to be wildly offEdit 2: i've checked the historical data (1985-2010) and I get 443mm
Although not the capital I bet Glasgow on the West Coast gets more than Edinburgh.
100% correct
Moar! More western cities please. Berlin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Rome, Milan...
Madrid is basically a desert
Cold Semi-Arid climate. Pretty similar to Iran of all places.
Or Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan plains. Some areas of inland Spain it's pretty much same scenario.
And it's only the 18th driest province capital in Spain. Sevilla, Zaragoza, salamanca, granada and murcia (which you might know) are all drier.Qudos to Almer√≠a which IS a desert, without the "basically". Less than 200mm a year ü§üMeanwhile, in the same country, pontevedra gets 1600mm a year.
According to that map, Sevilla is wetter than Madrid no?
You're right. Sevilla is rainier than Madrid, sorry.About the others the map IS a bit wonky. The average anual precipitations in Madrid are more on the 440mm mark.
I mean, it makes sense why Sevilla would be rainier than Madrid since it is close to the Atlantic with no mountains in the way to generate a rain shadow. Although it's the hottest part of Spain, it still gets a decent amount of rain during the winter when the westerlies prevail.
Ahhh yes the wet Catalonia....If only it currently rained a quarter of what is stipulated on that map, but we have a rampant drought in the reserves, unless you are referring to the fleeting torrential rain-storms of the summer.But the reservoirs and the countryside are pretty bad. And there is almost no snow in the Pyrenees.Where it is extraordinarily humid is Galicia and Northwest Spain, much more than even some areas of England.
I swear in Catalonia, at least in barcelona, when it rains‚Ä¶ it pours hardd for like a few mins. Then bam gone. None of that long tiny droplets throughout hours.
It's like flash big storms haha.Maybe in the Western Part of the Pyreene it's truly that rains more much, for the winds and storms that are coming from the Atlantic in that part..
Why is the city in montenegro wetter than everywhere else in Europe?
I think there are a lot of thunderstorms in the adriatic region.
The mediterranean. And It's not wetter than bergen.Basically, Warm humid air from the adriatic goes east into the mountainous Montenegro, where its cools down and tachan: precipitation
In this thread: people who have no clue what the chart is showing. "How is city X so dry it's been raining 30 days lol"
Podgoricia is getting numbers that seem more like the bay of Kotor, should be more like 1500
Yeah, something IS off in this map. I think It's based on a certain year.
Interesting that in the Paris map, the wet/dry border follows the old border between East and West Germany.
Good map OP, Bergen aside.The thought of Bergen as the capital gives me shivers. You couldn't find a more annoying and tiresome people.
R√¶vh√•l
Least annoying Bergenser.
That‚Äôs why Trondheim is the true capital
Stockholm in spring is basically a semi-arid climate
I read everything in english, understood what was going on, suddenly read "Wetter" which is weather in german and became confuse. Took a Moment to realize that it is still english, ocThank you for listening
guess London is drier than i thought
Mountains do be like that
Not wrong, but your totals pretty clearly include snow precipitation. Also the london map seems wrong. It makes london look like the driest place in the UK (I can‚Äôt imagine its precipitation total is that different than from the rest of the UK, and I have a hard time imagining southern Italy and southern France receiving more rain than London
Trust me, there‚Äôs nothing wrong about this. Mediterranean climate is a LOT of rain in autumn. London has many rainy days but just a small quantity of water overall
Southern Italy is mostly dry in summer but does receive heavy rainfall during the rest of the year.
Iirc, London is generally dryer than the rest of the UK, apart from a slice of the south-east, from other sources, so that seems legit. Just another way London is far from representative of the rest of the country, it is so often the exception that proves the rule.
It's a pity Eastern Europe isn't fully included. Also, Scotland isn't a country.
It‚Äôs literally a country in the United Kingdom
The syntagm "a country within a country" is a figure of speech for its autonomy, you know that right? The country is the United Kingdom.
Which is made up of 4 countries. Unless the National Archives are in the business of using mere figures of speech here?
Just because the UK calls its subdivisions countries doesn't mean they're what people usually mean when they say country, which is a sovereign state.
Tbf, there's also the Basque Country.
There's plenty of other examples. E.g. Greenland and the Faroe Islands within the Kingdom of Denmark, the countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, South Tyrol calls itself a country within the Republic of Italy.
Yes, they are, or different definition if you will. That being "land", "realm", not sovereign state.
Who actually cares lmao
We're on r/geography?
This is just wrong
Country doesn't mean just sovereign nations, it just means a land. It's also not unique to the UK, the Basque Country covers parts of both Spain and France, for instance. Words like country sort of predate the invention of modern nationalism, so it would make sense that their meaning isn't strictly exclusive to the modern concept of the sovereign nation-state. Worth noting that the word 'state' also does duty as both a term for sovereign and non-sovereign political groups as well.The joys of language.
I already said in another reply what definition the syntagm uses. Definition I didn't use writing my main comment, so you're off point.You're also wrong saying countries didn't exist before nationalism.

There‚Äôs a mistake with Bergen but WTF? This is a bit harsh lol
Don't worry OP, I liked your map.
Thanks üòÅ
Wie w√§r‚Äòs mit einem wetten Dreier? üòè
Most of Europe being wetter than London (emphasis on Balkan and Italy)? Here is me pressing X to doubt‚Ä¶
London is actually very dry. Droughts and hosepipe bans in the summer are common. I think the stereotype maybe comes from the fact that our winters tend to be overcast and drizzly.
Yeah, the UK has the thing where there's like a mist hanging in the air but it really doesn't just outright rain all that much.
RIP me living in Bergen.
As everyone else already said but I'm gonna say it to because why not.Bergen is not Norway's capital XD
Bergen yo wtf
Funny to describe the amount of rainfall in Europe with inches
Would be more interesting to do this with sunshine hours instead.  Some places it drizzles all year around (Ireland/UK), whereas other places get more rain, but it comes down short and heavy which is substantially better.
i get bergen but podgorica? i didn‚Äôt spect that
Paris data looks off..
Is it just me, or does this show that London creates a rain shadow to the East?Seeing as rain in Britain is fed by the Atlantic overturning current and all.
It‚Äôs not London but rather Britain asa big island, in itself
Some places are wetter than the ocean xD?
Bergen? Oslo is the capital and largest city
Yes,y mistake. I got carried away by the huge rainfall value
And btw Trondheim is the true vapital. And it‚Äôs in Tr√∏ndelag all the good food is
Yeah I've been to London. It's rainy, but it's an annoying weak rain, and comes in "pulses" or waves. These mini-downpours last perhaps 30 minutesMeanwhile Podgorica and that area in general has these horribly annoying all-rain days, and always in winter, too (and because people go there mostly in the dry summer, they don't notice). Where in Britain, rain is common, but not a "day-ruining occurrence," here it really is
Ah yes, the ocean is indeed wet
So why is Madrid drier than near the rest of Iberia?
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs because it sits at the centre of it. Far from the moist air of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean
Edinburgh isn't quite as wet as your source material suggests. It says on the Met Office 727.7 mm, which is 28.65 inches. Source: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-climate-averages/gcvwqum6h
I think there are areas in the iberian peninsula that rain more than Podgorica...

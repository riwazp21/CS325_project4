That‚Äôs amazing. He went hard with the rubber bands for onions.

everyone about to go hug their dad extra hard this week
I wish I could. Miss you dad ‚ù§Ô∏è
Same
‚Ä¶ god damnit, same
Same here...
Can I borrow a shovel?
Username check out.
Fuck that guy
ok not everyone
100% agreed.Last talked to him 17 years ago and for all I care he can die alone one day still wondering about what became of me after. Probably not, since he's a narcissist :)
My dad lived the same thing with his dad , 25years without talking. When my dad was on his deathbed he asked his father if he could come. I wish he never came , my father was so sad after this. He died a week after he came.
I lost my Dad to a sudden Heart attack ‚Ä¶ Love and Hug your Dads .
True. I will never forget the time with my dad playing with a bunch of plastic too animals for a few hours. I was only 5 but man...I will never forget it.
Father diesKid two seconds later: "Who the hell was that guy?"
Then when you die, they forget.
10/10
They are always ready to tackle any challenge.Playing with your own kids isn't a challenge, it was probably the highlight of his week.
Oh it can be.. my wife and I work from home so this is essentially our life.. going to work somewhere sounds like a nice vacation.
R u a bot?

That shit blew my mind.
I had to watch that part twice to figure out what happened. I'm as easily entertained as a 3 year old.
I was actually worried about it until I realized she was older. The first thing a 2-3yo would do is throw that in their mouth, especially after that performance üòÇ
That part had me going.
His day job is a hibachi grill chef.  ü§£
Yeah but then lost all of them trying to do that Salt Bae move haha
Salt daddy
raises finger to share a note on the name ‚Äúsalt daddy‚Äù and then shakes head and lives with it
Is that like a sugar daddy except he makes you poor?
yeah basically. either he has the money but wastes a sugar baby's time making them "earn" it, then doesn't pay up, or he doesn't have the money and gets defensive when the sex worker he's procured "makes the relationship transactional" and doesn't pay up. either way they're scamming sex workers, either by not paying for services or actually taking money from them through the usual check scams, paypal fraud etc.
So this is what salt bae is up to these days
Hustling over priced steaks at his restaurants.
Literally milking his meme for every penny he can
Don't act like you wouldn't.If I was a meme and could make money from it I'd be milking that shit harder than allowed during no nut November.
I'd at least pay my employees well while doing it.
Fuck those employees what do they do besides make me tons of money
This guy capitalisms
you bet you sweet a$$ i would.  boi my job is stressssssful
Oh he absolutely should. If stupid people want to overpay the guy to sprinkle some salt on their steaks, all the more power to him
https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/salt-bae-still-expanding-empire-190000485.htmlHe just keeps expanding and it's crazy
His restaurant in NYC just shut down for good recently I believe
This meal cost the kid $2000 in Monopoly money
This guy has more creativity in this one clip than all of Salt bae in his culinary history.
Ptsh, Salt Bae is overrated.Dad Bae is where it‚Äôs at.
If only..
Salt Bae could never
Upvote to make this guy the new salt bae.
The video didn't even start playing and I knew what was up
First Bluey‚Äôs dad, now this guy. I‚Äôll never live up to be a good dad.
You can be a very good dad if you do even half as much as this!
At this point, just don't abandon the family, and you're more than good in my eyes
Remember, we only see Bluey‚Äôs dad in 7 minute increments. If you can do something fun with your kids for 7 minutes a day, you‚Äôre on Bandit‚Äôs level.
This sounds like a piece of advice Bandit would give
even Bandit and Chilli got tired/overwhelmed, and that's okay. what's important, is that they always loved their daughters and engaged with them. they've had their imperfect moments, too. Bandit's gotten snippy with Bingo during a work call, and Chilli needed 20 minutes of alone time. but they apologized to their kids and explained their behavior. no one's ever a perfect person all the time, no parent is perfect all the time. but the love you have for your family is perfect.
100%. ‚ÄúI just need 20 minutes!‚Äù
Good call
This is like the easiest part of being a dad. The hard part is the stuff no one wants to see tiktoks of.  waking up early and preparing snaks for the kits soccer team, not losing your temper when they're being a brat, helping them with homework when they're not doing so hot in school, sacrficing for college, sacrificing for braces.
It's crazy how after I watched bluey with my daughter, it shocked me just how many games we play that we made up thar were near identical. What bluey doesn't tell you : it hacks at his mental health
The magnatile knife block is amazing.
It's definitely more expensive than a regular knife block, so that makes it fancier
That was the detail that really sent me. I love the onions too... dude is clever as hell.
Oh man I was waiting for him to do the sprinkle. This hilarious. Someday that little girl gonna figure out who salt bae is and realize her dad memes
lol, reminds me of when I got old enough to start watching more mature movies and realized 80% of my step-dad‚Äôs material was from Mel Brooks movies.At least he had good taste.
It's very nice to watch how a father entertains his daughter. They are always ready to do anything in the world.
It really moved me to see how beautiful it is to be a father.
My dad believed girls didn't need to spend time with their fathers. :(
I just played a game of ‚Äústore‚Äù with my daughter in your honor.
R u a bot?
Little girl. ‚ÄúUgh this taste likes plastic, I would like to see your manager please!‚Äù

That's a real chef, clean as you go
My kids : no don't put it away,  again!
[removed]
This shit look more appetizing than an overcooked steak wrapped in $2 worth of gold leaf and seasoned with Salt Bae's arm hairs
"Told you I could imitate Salt Bae!"
Just be happy it's not covered in a gallon of cheese
Dude definitely moves like a professional chef
maybe this is a nightly demand üòÇ I really hope it is because I would never get over the adorableness
I was literally gonna say that this guy 100% works in food prep
what? he only seared the steak on the second side for a few seconds!
I dunno, I don't think it was gonna get any more done
Kid: "I want Benihana!"Dad: "we have Benihana at Home!"
meh tastes chewy
"IT'S FUKING RAW!!!!!"
Dear lord my ovaries.
And my testes
and my axe!
and my chainsaw!!!
Andbmy besties
This is why women love guys with a good sense of humor.
Exactly! My boyfriend has a comedian level sense of humor (where he‚Äôs made multiple people per themselves from making them laugh so hard, me included üòÇ) but he plays with my kids like this and they absolutely love him (which makes me fall in love with him more and more every day seeing him engage with them the way he does) ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
She ate better than me
She got a better experience here than anyone would from Salt Bae's place
And he cleaned up! ü•π
Dad-bod salt bae. Awesome
Most wholesome and enjoyable salt bae I‚Äôve ever seen (OG salt bae is neither of these things)
I shared this with my ex-chef boyfriend and said the same
Best comment I've ever seen (Others aren't as good)
That's some good kitchen toy.
the steak that flips over lmao
The knife block was legit
People will give dudes shit for acting like children, but yo we can really shine when it comes to playing with our kids. Thats where the pay off is.
You‚Äôre right. The laughter of your kids when they think you‚Äôre absolutely hilarious, there‚Äôs nothing like it.
We have toys in the kids area of my library, and it's amazing how play food is the #1 choice of children of all ages. 12 year olds still delight in it!They always want to cook you something to eat and I make a huge deal over how delicious it is.
I'm 17 and have never stopped liking play food. I liked a great variety of toys and non-toys as a kid but play food was particularly memorable. Now, I have young siblings including a 2yo and I enjoy doing goofy things with their toys, especially the cooking set. Maybe not cook something for someone to eat but stick two halves of mismatching foods together (like a slice of tomato and one half of tempura), pretend to be very cool and slam the toy knife between them, purposely fail to slice them properly, stub my finger instead, and do a very comical "owww!"
My gosh, your little siblings must adore you!I've spent the last few years collecting cool play food for my future imaginary grandchildren, and gifting the extras to the library. Repeat visitors to the kids area are super excited when there are new pieces!
I'm 37 years old and own a donut shaped pillow from Target because it smells exactly like the toy donuts that were part of my play kitchen growing up.Then I bought a second one because the first one lost its scent and shape from being cuddled too much!
62 and bought a donut shaped pillow with a Rilakkuma bear crawling through it. Just because!
That was a ¬£1435 hot dog
That sir was awesome
The magnetile knife holder is genius.
I could even smell the food
Let the man cook!
This is the coolest dad in existence
Dad of the year has a new front runner
Haha wow even I had fun watching that, reminds me of how wild my imagination was when I was a kid
Sugar bae's looking busy
I‚Äôd eat it
This is wonderful!
Cool,very cool parody made
This was a win. Saved.
Father of the Year lol
Child kitchen playset is so neat and clean. My kids destroyed the one we got them.
Used to do this with my daughter all the time and loved it so much. Then her mom found a new man with $$$ and I haven‚Äôt seen my daughter in so so so long it hurts so much everyday. Edit: but this did make me smile :)
Then they grow up and don't want to talk to you any more. As the father of an 18 year old daughter, this is a bit painful.
Why does it suddenly look edible
dad of the year
I hope my future
wait people have dads???? gee
10/10.Better than the real thing.
He's like an exact mixture of Yoko Ono, John Lennon, and Ozzy Osbourne
It‚Äôs a low key advertisement for that LG clothes steaming closet in the corner
Damn - I wondered what that was.
That what
Lol‚Ä¶that‚Äôs fantastic !
üòôüëå
Legend
Infinitely better than real salt bae
Lol the pajama pants at the end got me üòÇ
The real commitment here is wearing the gloves. üòÇ
Oh wow he's amazing. His kid is gonna grow up with fond memories of her father. It's obvious how much he dotes on her.
one of the cutest freaking things I've ever seen in my life
THAT SKILLET IS STILL HOT!Irresponsible parenting. SMH
I love how committed he was to the role. Kept the pained expression of concentration going the whole time...
You know it looks legit when she for real ate the hot dog. üòÇ
And that's how you spend quality time with your kiddos ü§ò
Fisher price salt bae
This is how a real men looks like
Her little claps a little over halfway through the video are the best.
Iam not crying ,you‚Äôre crying  this is so beautiful to watch
He is doing it SO damn well, I would have bitten that damn hot dog and lost a tooth!!!
"Can I try, dad?""It's not your turn yet, wait your turn... how's your hotdog?"
This made me smile
The smile on his daughter's face is more than enough of a payment for him.
Dads def done tappanyaki in his lifetime.
Bro this got me hungry
We have Salt Bae at home!Salt Bae at home:
I can‚Äôt copeeee, so cute
this was captivating as hell
Dads are so under rated‚Ä¶.. respect, popsü´°
I like this Salt Bae.
This is great but where the hell was my hibachi playset as a child?!
I'm here for soy bae
His skill is undeniable. Oh so verifiable. Long hair. Dark shades. Made for the world certifiable, bahbay
why do i want to eat it
Salt bae-bae
More edible than that poor gold plated meat.
That'll be $920
That'll be 500 Dollars little girl
Still doesn't compare to the gourmet banger I had over the weekend of slime, window putty, a hotweels car, and moist half eaten chips. chef's kiss
‚ù§Ô∏èüëà
That's nice and sweet, the first time. Now let's see him do that 20 times in a row 5 days straight.
The steak is fking raw
Both Mother AND fathers are parents of the world.Seems like a Great dad, but the text in the video throws me off a bit like mothers aren't good parents. Unless he's just addressing all the parents of the world.
Sweet video but the music is a terrible fit
This is actually hilarious lol
The DP deserves some love too.
Dad Bae
He nailed it! Great performance haha!
It's amazing. I could even smell the food
That was the best epic man your little girl has an awesome dad
This is so incredibly cute. What a great dad!
That move with the onion/rubber bands was :chef's_kiss:
I see the competition for the #1 Dad headband remains fiercely competitive!
I'm actually hungry.
Can't wait to see the bill reaction video!
is his knife holder magnetiles?!
Dang dude, stop making us other dads look bad! I‚Äôve got to work on my plastic food skills
Dad went so hard just playing "restaurant" with his kid. He didn't need to but I'm glad he did. Kid is so lucky.
These kids dolls are eating better then meüò≠
My lower back twitches with memories when he carried that play kitchen through the door.
The Salt Bae!
What a beautiful video!! Hopefully she will remember and appreciate this when she‚Äôs older!ü•πü•∞
I used to do dad stuff like this all the time for my daughter. She's 14 now and my wife asked her the other day if she remembers how I would play with her. She says she doesn't remember me EVER playing with her, but totally remembers mom playing.  My wife looked at me and just about cried because she said she's never seen me so instantly hurt.  Like, WTAF kid??
A better Salt Bae than Salt Bae

This happened yesterday. I picked up my FIL from the Airport yesterday, he was limping on the left side which was unusual considering he is in a decent shape. He had not eaten for 6-7 hrs so we thought this could be low blood sugar. We made him eat some food, but he still felt weakness in his left side. My wife put her AW8 on his wrist and ran an ECG. AF was detected, we ran another ECG after 15 mins and still the same result. We rushed to a cardiac specialist. The doctor ran an ECG and 2D echo and confirmed AF. He was admitted to the hospital and after some more tests, a stroke was confirmed. The AW detecting an AF alerted us and possibly averted what could have been a major health issue. I am glad we had the technology available and made good use of it. Thanks Apple !
Next step: get FIL his own watch and make sure he uses it!
He is pretty old school and struggles to use his most basic android phone. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll help
If you have an iPhone and don‚Äôt mind setting it up for ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äù to use while it‚Äôs connected on your device, he doesn‚Äôt need to do much besides wear it. Parents use it to track their children on find my.
A-Fib detection and ECG functionality is disabled when setup that way.
Lmao god forgot you could do this‚Ä¶ tracking your children using Apple Watch that‚Äôs hilarious.
Just throw an apple tag in each of their shoes
Nah then they can just take it out or throw shoes away. Gonna need to inject it under their skin.
It will! The watch will automatically detect afibs as long as his using it
Isn‚Äôt by virtue of having to activate it and touch the crown mean that it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúautomatically detect‚Äù anything?
No, automatic irregular rhythm notifications do not require taking ECGs.https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208931
This is correct.   My Apple series 3 told me I was in AFIB and I don‚Äôt even have ekg capabilities.
I think afibs is only when doing ECG?
Not true. See /u/anamexis comment. https://old.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/17v11oq/apple_watch_possibly_saved_a_relatives_life/k987xlc/
My Apple Watch SE detected my afib. Went to cardiologist to confirm. Could have saved my life or at least avoided a stroke! Immediately went on blood thinners and scheduled an ablation.
That‚Äôs tough. He does at least need to remember to charge it and put it on. Hard to monitor if you‚Äôre not around him daily.
The Withings watches can detect AFib. They‚Äôre pretty basic devices.
The watch will do the work for him
Def get him Apple Watch ultra too if ya can it‚Äôs pretty tanky üê±
Apple‚Äôs a lot easier to use that anything android, especially for old people.
Were there any other symptoms of a stroke? The weakness on the left side would have triggered emergency care long before the AW for me.
Old people... especially old men.My dad is a freaking doctor and ignored his numb left arm for days. One morning he suffered a stroke, fell, had no one around and had to wait a whole day for help. Now, he is permanently paralysed on his left side.It's sad. Always listen to your body folks :/
You are right. We men tend to ignore our bodies and this incident is a learning for me
Once I got diagnosed with Cancer I upgraded my AW so it could be used as a locator device, detects falls and the I‚Äôve fallen and I can‚Äôt get up situation. It was especially good when I used a walker in the house and didn‚Äôt have overnight care anymore. The phone is hard to hold/carry when using a walker in jammies. I‚Äôm so sorry about your dad. My dad was a paramedic for 20 yrs and this spring had 2 significant cardiac events. The first one he just took 20 nitroglycerin and thought the searing pain would stop. 3 days later he went to primary care who sent him to ED and he drove himself. He‚Äôs been in AF ever since. He did the same again 2 mos later where they finally put stents and a new valve in days after he checked himself out because he felt fine. He‚Äôs telling everyone he‚Äôs all fixed. They basically propped up his heart with bubblegum and popsicle sticks.  Sucks.
Waiting 15 minutes for a second EKG after such well-known possible stroke symptoms is certainly a choice. Sudden-onset weakness on one side of the body (especially in an older patient) really should clue you in that they need hospital now, not after you try your fancy new gadget. Good on OP for applying the tools they thought would help (and eventually using them to make the right decision), but this really isn't a good example of how people should use AW health monitoring. https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/signs_symptoms.htm
Sometimes after a long sit or rest, your limbs go numb/powerless, especially in elders, so sometimes you know something is not going right, but you don't know if you can wait it out or it's really a medical issue.
I am curious: how does one go about rushing a loved one to a cardiac specialist? Does your family have a history of heart issues and you have one on call? If I were in a similar situation, I'd take the patient to urgent care or the emergency room. I didn't know you could even see a cardiac specialist by just showing up at their office?
Seriously, it's just crazy to me that they waited to put an Apple Watch before attempting to get any kind of medical assistance.
Things work differently in different places. At the time the incident happened I was in deep traffic travelling from the airport to home. What we did was our way of identifying if there could be an issue. And yes, in my country we can rush to a cardiac specialist in case of emergency, which we did
Mine saved my life back in February!
How did it help?
It saved my life too! Twice. Hope he recovers fully and gets a smart watch!
How did it help?
Thanks for the post by the way. It reaffirms my decision to get a watch with an ECG. Even though hopefully I will never need to use it.
Well there‚Äôs no harm in using it every once in a while. I do. Who knows maybe you feel fine but your heart isn‚Äôt
I‚Äôve never seen so many abbreviations in one post. Damn this was hard to understand as a non native English speaker
No problems......and I am from Norway üá≥üá¥
Yeah what is AF?
Atrial fibrillation
What does AF mean?
It stands for atrial fibrillation, it‚Äôs what the ECG on the Apple Watch checks for.
Thanks for the clarification, my Apple Watch is older so I don‚Äôt have that function
Unless you have an Apple Watch Series 2 or older, your watch can detect AFib. See the chart halfway down this page. https://www.apple.com/healthcare/apple-watch/ECG is needed to check on demand (series 4 and up),  but the Series 3 and SE watches can do it passively.
I have a series 3, I don‚Äôt have the ECG app or AFib history at least that‚Äôs what it says from the link, not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted for that haha
afib alerts are different than afib history, fwiw.
Btw AF can be deadly
No. AF can cause a stroke which can be deadly, but if the AF is treated and you are on a blood thinner, it is not deadly in itself.
That‚Äôs the point, AF can induce things that are deadly. It can cause blood clots, which in turn is what can lead to a stroke, heart failure, or other issues.
What a great story!! I‚Äôm glad to hear the watch helped your FIL and also that you had the presence of mind to think about putting it on him to check things out. :) I‚Äôm a young cardiac patient and my watch has helped immeasurably when I end up in the ER with arrhythmias. I quite literally couldn‚Äôt live without it.
Wow. Thats incredible.
Amazing. What version of watch ??
Message says aw8 so probably aw8?
Awesome! Great job!
I hate that they have disabled ECG in my region.
Same
I believe it
My new PCP is very old school which is not bad but for some reason he doesn‚Äôt take advantage of newer technology. At my last checkup, I was showing him how I used my Apple Watch to help me monitor my health. I demonstrated the EKG app and explained its limitations. As he was watching my EKG he was amazed pointing out all the different parts of the wave (which I don‚Äôt understand). I think he was pleased that I am proactive monitoring my health.
Which model of Apple Watch has an ecg
I believe series 4 and up
I have a SE. Does it need setting up?
Apple Watch SE doesn‚Äôt have ECG.
I put my watch on my dad when he was slowly dying from brain cancer, as in hospice they don‚Äôt have any monitors. It was strange for someone laying down and sleeping to have a heart rate of 130+

It’s worth noting that Iowa is a huge outlier in wind energy, but that its success is not replicable by any other state. Iowa’s wind energy output is only achievable due to its unique location in a high to low pressure weather system caused by the simple fact Illinois sucks and Nebraska blows.
Can't argue with the science
I’m from Illinois, but I still chuckled.…I’ve also been to Iowa, so…
So... you've basked in the glory of the most verdant fields of corn man has ever laid eyes on. Hell yeah.
That was amazing. Fantastic joke structure
Can confirm, it’s very windy here. Never knew the true science behind it…now I do. Thank you!
Couldn't, couldn't we just build more wind farms in Iowa and use that electricity in other states? All the states minus Texas is already connected by two national grids, so it shouldn't be difficult, no?
He was making a joke
The more distance between power sources and end users the more energy loss you get. By a lot
Couldn't, couldn't we just build more wind farms in Iowa and use that electricity in other states?That's exactly how the grid works and how Iowa can achieve this stat in the first place because it's connected to the larger grids. This is counting "in which state" electricity is generated (produced), not where it's consumed. The wind farms that are in Iowa count for Iowa's production.
Yes and no. It depends on the distance the electricity has to travel - we don't have access to room temp superconductors, so a lot of energy is lost just during transmission. Wires are basically super leaky pipes.
Fortunately for Kansas, Oklahoma also sucks
Texas actually produces much more wind power than Iowa, it's just a bigger state so it also produces more power from other sources.
Please kindly note the referenced high to low pressure system appears to have created a whoosh sound above your head.
Was solar not any states top energy producer so it wasn't included in the legend?
There are no states that even come close. California has the largest percentage (~27%), but natural gas still provides almost twice as much electricity as solar in CA.The first state to get a majority from solar will almost certainly be a southern state (much higher insolation). But those states are lagging behind on renewables.
This data is from three years ago too. While solar is the fastest growing source and has likely closed the gap, I’d still guess it is not close to being 1st in any state yet.
can someone ELI5 why some of the barren deserts of Arizona/Nevada/New Mexico couldn't be used for massive solar farms?
They can, at to a point they are, I just got back from a Solar Farm in Midland Texas. Same kind of land.But you run into the same problem wind does, where it’s being built, where it should be built, there aren’t a ton of people. So distribution becomes the problem.It’s why Off Shore wind can be so huge. That’s where our major population centers are and where we need the power.
I know Texas has a bunch of solar and wind but natural gas is still cheap. I'm surprised that arizona has coal as it's highest, you'd think solar would be a no brainer in that state
AZ is natural gas by the chart.  New Mexico is coal.Also, a lot of AZ is mountainous forest terrain.  We have/are a part of one of the largest contiguous pine forest in the world.
Yeah, since Arizona has Palo Verde and doesn’t consume a ton of power I would have thought that nuclear would be the top source, but apparently not.
Yeah, you'd think. But last I saw, Arizona is still under 10%.
Solar makes up like 5% of total energy production so no.
Yes.As for reasons why and some context:Most solar installations have been fairly recent and have been installed as replacement for the retirement of older power plants since there has been little growth in electricity demand for the last two decades or so, so it's been a rather slow process.Depending on the state, a significant portion of solar installations are smaller installations such as on homes or commercial property while EIA generally only tracks utility scale generation sources. Outside of solar, there are pretty much no smaller scale generation sources that cumulatively adds up to a significant source of generation so when considering total electricity production, EIA stats are going to undercount solar versus other installation sources.
Yea it’s not that big right now. Like North Carolina has the 4th most solar in the country but it’s still only about 7% of the electricity. Obama’s solar investments had a huge impact but when Trump got into office it stopped growing at all.
Jesus WV, save some coal for Xmas stockings would ya?
Coal is a borderline jobs program in WV. There's not much else going on economically. Without it the state would be in MUCH worse shape.
It really isn't though, that's a common misconception that's propagated as part of the political culture wars.  A long time ago, the coal industry was a major employer in WV... but those days are gone.Only 11,000 of WV's almost 2 million people are coal workers.  It's a dying industry, and it's been largely automated.  They just have massively outsized representation because they represent the idea of well paid hard working blue collar people.
I’ve heard they have a fairly robust fentanyl distribution industry.
But wait… I thought only blue states were crime-riddled?Drugs? In MY backyard? Why I never!
This is one of my favorite links to pull out whenever anyone starts pretending like crime only exists in blue states. It’s amazing how clear the correlation is between drug overdose deaths and poorly managed conservative state governments. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/drug_poisoning_mortality/drug_poisoning.htmThe reply is usually along the lines of “yeah but violent crime is definitely higher in blue states”. Nope, the worst states for gun-related deaths are almost exactly the same as the drug overdoses. https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/gun-deaths-by-state
Little known fact about WV. Electric vehicles, among other things, actually increase demand for coal in that part of the country. It's booming right now.
Cool map, "Type of Electricity" is an odd title, maybe "largest source of electricity"?Cuz there is really only one type of electricity... Still a great map, thank you!
Map is showing production, not consumption. Not so long ago the Intermountain West was full of coal fired plants supplying California, and power imports continue.
Thankfully in 2022 wind surpassed coal as New Mexico’s #1 energy source.
Minnesota’s top type is only 26%? Off to google I go to find out about why MN is so diversified.

Everyone hating on Nuclear, but I’ve lived all over the USA, and the most affordable electricity is in Tennessee.   $160 a month in the summer with two ACs running all the time with two stay at home people on laptops and extra monitors all day.   For comparison in Texas that same bill for the same months would have been mid $300s to low $400s.    Hydroelectric and Nuclear are worth it
Nuclear Gang here.
Nuclear is kinda just hard to trust in an environment where cost-cutting is seen as more important than maximizing safety. I feel that we live in too cynical a time to ever get past Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The airlines do it….  Super tight on spending yet extremely safe.  It’s possible.
Solar energy kills 7X the number of people every year than nuclear has claimed in the past 50 years. Nuclear is proven, and the technology is better than ever. Powerful lobbies who stand to profit greatly at the expense of the USA and EU nations work night and day to ensure people share your sentiments about Nuclear.  China will tell you... "Nuclear Bad Solar Good".... They just want our money.
I have no agenda or anything but I’m just curious, how does solar kill?
The sun is a deadly laser
so true
Do they have yearly comparisons?
Hydroelectric to me is the most beautiful. I once read a study saying only 5% of the dams in the us are hydroelectric and we have a massive untapped energy source if we just convert them to hydroelectric power dams.
Dams can have a huge environmental impact too. They really fucked up the Colorado River and drowned one of the prettiest canyons in the west, Glen Canyon.
They also affect fish migration patterns.
I heard dams attract bears
And sediment distribution.
Also, Ethiopia's new Blue Nile River Dam that MAY have significant impacts down river in Egypt and Sudan and my ultimately lead to conflict.
A fellow real life lore fan. How do you do?
I think they are talking about current dams that do nothing but control water flow. Not making new dams.
A significant portion of dams in the US hold back a pretty minor height of water.According to NID's database there are over 91,000 "proper dams".Of these, only around 3000 have a hydraulic height above 50', and a 1350 of these are reservoirs/water supply/irrigation which limits their use as power generation.That leaves ~1600 dams, and of those over 600 are already hydroelectric.So when you hear that most dams in the US aren't hydroelectric, please take into consider that while improving our hydroelectric capacity is important, there aren't a ton of good candidates and a significant amount of those 90k dams have primary uses not suited for hydroelectric.
Dams are cool but pretty debilitating to stream ecosystems =( And as we've seen with hoover, even a big dam isn't a guarantee the water will always flow.
Its because most dams are dinky and lack the height to make it worthwhile, hyrdo was the first generation source so its not from lack of trying.
There really aren’t many places in the US to build a dam that produces considerable energy. Almost all the places where it makes sense to build a hydroelectric dam are either already dammed or they protected by environmental regulations.
Just note that rivers are foundational aspects of the environment. Many species completely depend on them for existence. Damming has a major detrimental effect to the environment. Not to mention that the process of constructing a dam in and of itself will produce a ton of gas emissions as heavy machinery is involved.While it is cleaner power than coal or natural gas, whether or not hydroelectric power is worth all the above is not absolute. The whole energy situation is far more complex than most people would like.
I was just talking about this the other day with someone. We have so many damn dams in MN and hardly any are used for power. I see millions in wind and solar going up all over and in MN solar seems very pointless.
Does solar output take into consideration private homes/businesses, or is this just utility company production? Is there a way to measure private sector solar?
Proud to live in a nuclear state
Maybe less beautiful, but this graphic is more informative: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/road-to-decarbonization-united-states-electricity-mix/
Washington wants to remove all the Dams because it’s not a renewable resource.
Since when is hydro not considered to be a renewable energy source?
When the water runs out because the climate gets funky and the mountains run out of ice.
The vast majority of the water in the Columbia Basin comes from precipitation and snowmelt, not glacial ice melt.
I believe the dams there are old and in disrepair.
I work in Hydro in Washington state. They're looking into decommissioning some on the Snake River because of the environmental impacts on fish and a push from the Native American community to have access to better fishing. The dams near Mount Rainier are big money makers, are owned by city governments, and are still in very good condition for their age. Couldn't imagine the state would want to shut them down anytime soon.
That's absolutely not the reason, it's due to lawsuits over salmon migration
[deleted]
Most of Nevada is desert.   That dam barely keeps up with demand from Vegas
Well, today I learned that my state of Illinois has nuclear energy.
This information is a bit dated since it is only showing 2020 annual average numbers. On mobile, so I had trouble finding state-level breakdowns, but here is a national source. Nationally, wind generation has increased ~30% from 2020 to 2022 and solar generation has increased by ~60%. In 2022 Wind was approximately 11% of National electricity generation (up from 9% in 2020) and solar was just under 4% in 2022 (up from 2% in 2020)https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec7_6.pdfGoing forward, most of the near to medium term growth will be in solar generation based on what is sitting in the different interconnection queues across the US
Why not use data that's not 4 years old?

So generally, kids are hungry and tired first thing in the morning...
I'm feeling an affinity...
Wait until they get a job, they can feel like that all day every day.
I much prefer being employed than when I had to go to school. You don't have to bring your work home, you get the weekend for yourself and even get payed for the work you do
Same. I am VERY happy to not be in school anymore. Work is still work obviously, but it‚Äôs much preferable overall.
Also, you can choose your job, have a whole lot more rights and ability to handle conflicts. You can find something with the hours you prefer, never have to sit through another lecture from a self important English teacher who clearly misreads every single book covered in class.Like, if someone hit me or harassed me at school they‚Äôd get a talking to, and maybe not even that depending on who it was.If someone punched me at work I‚Äôd laugh my way to the bank, or at the very least they‚Äôre immediately fired and I‚Äôm taking the day off to visit the doctor.
I mean weekend for yourself is very much not guaranteed depending on your job lol
Good thing you can choose a job that gets weekends
Same with the part about not having to bring work home with you
Speak for yourselfThe drain of waking up at 5 and all the rubbish that comes with school and being young, just does not compare to "employment"
For free
They are teenager, they most likely have jobs
Dude do you need help? I got some snack packs for you
Sample size is 13 so even that conclusion isn‚Äôt justified.
sample size of 13 is quite small
but organized into this beautiful and information dense bar graph

Every morning I have my students do a quick check-in through a Google Form. This allows me the chance to understand how their feeling without them having to come to me directly (there is an option to choose to have me speak with them if need be about something going on.) This is a collection of their responses from the first marking period of the school year. Students are able to check as many boxes as they feel for that morning as we all understand you can feel multiple ways at the same time.I forgot to include these are 16-18 year olds.
What about "sad", wasn't it an option or is just no one sad?
Two thoughts on this: I found it at that age hard to recognise "sad" because it can also feel like anger, upset or tired. Sadness is one of those emotions that I think gain a lot of complexity during puberty, that is hard to appreciate or recognise while it's happening.And the other thing is admitting you're sad fearing consequences or exposure.
And now you've made me want to rewatch Inside Out! They show that exact complexity gearing into puberty.
There were some responses but less than the lowest number on thi graph.
Add 'horny' as an option and I bet you get a new leader.
Ya, but then they‚Äôd have to update their resume and who has the time?!
You sound like a really nice teacher
to understand how their feelingthey're
Gosh, I hope you‚Äôre not an English teacher.
Was there an option for "good" or "ok" or "fine"?
Fine is the 4th highest response.
I would have put tired every single day in Highschool. I was constantly running on 4-5 hours of sleep and jacked up on energy drinks
Thank you for having the legend of colors ordered by the results!(I'm kinda colorblind, and if everyone did this I would have a much better time on the internet.)
Fair. I would have preferred if they simply labeled each bar though.
Yeah, Tired and Upset are the same colour and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.
Kind of sad that so many kids are hungry in the morning. Hopefully they all get enough to eat at school.
It‚Äôs a big reason why I keep a ‚Äúpantry‚Äù in the room that they can take from no questions asked. It gets bare at times but I try to keep it as stocked as often as possible.
You sound like a good teacher
They also beat misbehaving children with a cane, but nobody is perfect.
Food insecurity is definitely a thing, but I also went through four years of high school barely ever eating breakfast because I was lazy and slept in till the last second every day and had to mad dash out the door. There was always plenty to eat.
That's still sad.. We know teenagers need more sleep and need to sleep later but we still keep making them get up early anyway...
I used to stay up way too late every night too. I could‚Äôve been much more rested with an earlier bedtime. I just stayed up late too much, I still have that problem.
Yes, you stayed up too late because, as a teenager, your body clock is set to do that. It's completely natural and not a moral failing. Teenagers get tired later and need more sleep, but we keep telling them they're lazy and forcing them out of their natural patterns.Society does that to adult night owls, too... I don't get it.
I did this too, but it wasn't my fault - it wasn't your fault either. I have delayed sleep phase syndrome and ADHD. A significant portion of teenagers become night owls during this time thoughAnd high schools start early so elementary parents can get to work on time, and the district saves money on bussing. It's fucked.
Not that this is necessarily you, but I always stayed up too late as a kid, was always tired and some teachers blamed my parents even though they put me to bed early and were always trying to get me to fall asleep earlier‚Ä¶later as an adult it became a recurring problem with college and work‚Ä¶.eventually saw a sleep doctor and it turns out I have delayed sleep phase syndrome and a non-24 hour cycle so the whole time I had a circadian rhythm disorder and i wasn‚Äôt just a stubborn kid refusing to go to bed.
I went to high school in a place where  lots of kids were food insecure and/or had bad home lives. Yea kids skip meals but there are also kids that are pretty much always hungry and get most of their food from school. It‚Äôs sad to see that‚Äôs their first thought when asked how they‚Äôre feeling.
this is defintely true sometimes but others definitely elect to get more sleep instead of eating first thing. i made that choice myself since i would have cut myself down to less than 4 hours per night if i needed to make myself breakfast.
If these are high schoolers, they‚Äôre likely old enough that they forego breakfast for more sleep. Which most of the adult population does too.
Yeah it‚Äôs sad, as most know hunger makes it harder to learn, and we have plenty of studies backing that up. It is obvious to most people, but a lot of people never pause to think about the implications. Kids who skip breakfast either voluntarily (usually as teens) or because they don‚Äôt have enough food in the home don‚Äôt learn as well, and thus are more likely to perform poorly in school.
All schools should offer breakfast and lunch to ALL students free of charge.
My kid confuses boredom with hunger.
I confuse being tired for hunger!
It is sad for some, but also in highschool most of these kids are just at that age where they need a lot of nutrition. Not to mention the majority of them are athletes.  I was constantly hungry in high school and it wasn't because of lack of availability.
not a criticism of content - but presentation. why did you not put the labels under each bar instead of essentially shifting everything to the right?
I used an online template to create it at the end of the day.
OP was tired and hungry and thats the best they could do right now.
And thats okay
Kids should not be waking up that early. Our system sucks
School starting at 7-8 is waaaaaayyy too gotdamn early. Plenty of studies out there showing the benefits of school starting later. But of course most school systems don‚Äôt give a shit.
I heard/read somewhere it‚Äôs also decided in part by the bussing system. They use the same busses for elementary and middle school students, so unless you‚Äôre going to double/triple the number of busses in an area, the starts need to stagger. I wonder if they could flip the order and have the younger kids start earlier
This would work better if the legend didn't exist and you simply labeled each bar. As it is, I had to look a bar, identify the color, move my eyes to the legend, find the correct one, then read it. Thankfully the order was the same as the data. If you instead just moved text from the legend directly under the bar, it wouldn't have that problem.
They start school at 8am? Damn, I get that they're tired, puberty brains and all.. :')Good system though!
My school has kids in class working by 7:20. It's terrible.
Yeah that's how my school was. And I had to go to stupid seminary in the morning so for me it started at 6:05. I didn't sleep for most of high school.
Whaaaaat the F.... That can't be good for the developing brain...Nowadays there are school where I live (western Europe) that start at like 10:00, to accommodate that developing puberty brain. Time before that is used for teacher meetings, etc. But the school where I teach starts at 8:30, like most schools I know.
Wtf, I woke up at 6 and that was bad for me
Same with my high school. They sent out a survey asking if we wanted to start school at 9 AM and for some reason we all voted no ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
When I was a pup this was when we started.  I had to ride a bus for an hour too, so that meant i was getting upat 5:45am every day.  That alone made me hate school.  It was like being in a gulag and taking the bus to the mines every day.
Thinking back as a poor kid, this tracks.
Give me your hungry and tired
Holy shit it‚Äôs Shlash from gunsh n roshesh
Somehow I feel like the graph would look slightly better if the color labels are right below the colored towers. On the other hand, very interesting üëç
You got 162 liars in there
Perhaps they are mad, tired and frustrated because they have to fill out a form every morning and are hungry for change
Doesn‚Äôt frustrated, upset, and angry roughly mean the same thing? Why are there 3 choices for negative emotions but only 1 choice for happy? Or am I misunderstanding the methodology that was used?
Frustrated - feeling a lack of control or lack of understanding in a situation Upset - bothered, annoyed, ruffled, or distinctly disappointedAnger - heightened pulse, strong desire to fight or flee, a sense of hostility
There‚Äôs some overlap but to me at least, no, they are not synonyms.
Your question is on the order of, "why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?"
Life is hard and doesn‚Äôt care about your feelings.  If they went to bed at a decent hour instead of staying up playing games they wouldn‚Äôt be tired at 8:00am.  Geez, i get up at 4:00 am to go to work.   My kids get up between 6-6:30 am.  We all go to bed between 8-8:30.
Wait until they taste their own bile each morning while on the job for the next 45 years. School won‚Äôt seem so bad.
these darn kids, they should just suck it up and suffer in silence, don‚Äôt they know that‚Äôs what mature adult‚Äôs with Stockholm syndrome do?

I guess the question is self explanatory, thank you for your replies!
It was used to denote the Spanish dollar (the main currency of the Americas in use both in Spanish but also Portuguese and English colonies, Philippines etc). The US dollar is named and modeled on it. The origins are unclear but apparently there’s some credence to p over S (for peso duro) and some theories see it related to marks of the Potosi mine, by far the largest silver mine ever discovered and exploited in the Americas where majority of the silver dollars were minted.US adopted the currency in 1792 basically saying “we’ll issue coins the same value as Spanish dollar and call it the same”. It’s used for a ton of other currencies like Mexican peso and Brazilian real because well, they also inherited the Spanish dollar.
Related fun fact, the potosi mine is still in production, the silver and tin are basically gone but it’s rich in trace minerals and currently run by a cooperative of workers. I’ve been there, the history is wild. Potosi was once the richest city in the world.
Going in that mine is a wild experience. So old school. Surprised not more tourists get stuck in there
It's unnervingly reminiscent of industrial revolution British coal mines in both how the mine is operated, and safety.My highlights from going into the mine:I almost diedWhen I asked why the miners all had what appeared to be swollen cheeks, the guide explained that it was coca leaves. "it gives them energy to carry on working"The miner's alcohol is 98%. Yes, They drink 98% alcohol. That shit isn't so much drank as inhaled.While chewing coca leaves and drinking 98% alcohol, they still operate heavy machinery.
I think I'll preemptively nope the fuck outta that experience...
Honestly, it's a fascinating experience, but you can probably get a more tourist friendly equivalent by doing a mine tour somewhere in the UK like Durham or snowdon.
If you take a trip to Vancouver or Whistler canada, there’s a copper mine at Britannia Beach that was once the most productive copper mine in the British Empire.It’s now a mining museum.(It has also featured in a lot of movies and TV shows)
Thanks for the suggestion. I'm actually planning to head to vancouver, so will have to check it out when I get there
Me wondering how you almost died...keeps reading... never mind I think I could guess.
Lol, actually totally unrelated to those. The mine entrance is at ~4500m. From there, it was a half-miles walk into the mountain then down a narrow hole ~15m deep. Ventilation is also lacking, but non non-existent. I was coning back up the scree slope (no ladder) and blacked out near the top.
Sounds like you didn't consume enough coca leaves.
That's your solution to everything.
You can’t spell panacea without… well some of the letters are also in coca leaf!
Historians marvel at how the Incas built Macchu Picchu, I just assumed everyone was strung out on coca leaves day and night.But seriously coca leaves are a way of life in south america. I'm not going to say they aren't intoxicating or good for you but they're so much less concentrated than extracted and purified cocaine.
Unless they are drinking some alcohol that isn't ethanol, it's not 98%. The azeotrope of ethanol and water hits at 95%, which makes it virtually impossible to distill to a higher percentage. That's why Everclear and similar grain alcohols are 190 proof.
Whelp, that's concerning. I could be misremembering, but I remember thinking it was nearly pure alcohol. Fwiw, I'm not actually sure it was alcohol produced for human consumption.Edit:had a quick look. Definitely claims to be 98%
>95% concentrations use organic drying agents like benzene and it leaves trace amounts, you do NOT want to drink that. Also if open to air it will draw moisture from the air and revert back to ~95%. You can get Lab grade at 99.9%, 99.5%, and others, but it is STILL toxic(not just ethanol) and not safe to consume.
There is a way to get above 95% in a food safe manner, this company exists:https://culinarysolvent.com/products/200-proof-food-grade-alcoholI don't know how they do it, they claim they use a pot still but they'd need to use some sort of mechanical or chemical process to get to 200 proof.EDIT: they use ceramic molecular sieves, which are a cool reusable type of mechanical filter that absorb water.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_sieve
Sounds like lab ethanol; You just need atmospheric control for that. They are distilling it in a closed system with totally dry air. It gets put into a stoppered glass bottle and if you don't leave it open for any length of time, it will be fine. Pure ethanol is hygroscopic, i.e. it will absorb moisture out of the air until it dilutes itself down to ~95% pure. If you leave the lab alcohol open you've ruined it and it needs to be redistilled because it has water in it.
Molecular sieve is what we used in industry. It's fine to drink. I've been to dozens of alcohol plants and I'm not aware of any that used an entrainer.
Are you sure it’s not 98 proof?
The claim was for 98%, and it was definitely the strongest stuff I've had by aa considerable margin, but being proof would be more likely.Nearly everywhere I look, though, makes the claim of 98%. Whatever the stuff is, it looks more like an industrial chemical bottle than a recreational drink.
Well, this just throws their whole story into doubt! Maybe their "coca leaves" weren't even coca, but just oregano!
Maybe their "coca leaves" weren't even coca, but just oregano!Mostly Maui-Waui, but It's Got Some Labrador In It
Did you go into any of the stores? They sold Caiman (the pure alcohol) coca leaves, mining helmets, flashlights and dynamite! I wonder if they would have sold me a stick…
The other 2% of the 98% EOH death-in-a-bottle is likely to be the benzene they used to strip out the remaining 5% of water. Salud!
I went around 2000, it was crazy. We were told we had to bring coca leaves and alcohol to give to the miners along the way.The alcohol wasnt drinking alcohol, it was more like rubbing alcohol. And we were warned not to drink it, just to give it to the miners.They told certain people they couldn't come in because they were too big and couldn't fit in the holes.There was no safety equipment, we were just jumping over mine shafts and scrambling around.Good times!
Something like this?https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-miners-drinking-alcohol-inside-cerro-rico-mountain-potosi-bolivia-26647896.html
Holy, wait, what? I need to know more about this place. Anyone have videos?
What you just described is unnerving enough…. I don’t need to go there to be unnerved.
The Spanish Dollar is what we colloquially call “Pieces of eight”, because it was scored so it could be broken into 8 “bits” to make change. This is why the 25 cent piece is called a “quartet”, and colloquially called “two bits”. It’s also why, until fairly recently (around the turn of the century), stock prices were quoted as dollars and eighths rather than dollars and cents.
Related fact: The Lion Dollar/Daalder or Leewendaalder was the predecessor to the U.S. Silver Dollar. The coins were first struck in 1575 in the Dutch province of Holland. The last Lion Dollars were struck in 1697. The dutch kept using a daalder up until the 1970’s, and another version (Rijksdaalder) up until the early 2000. And since the dutch set up Wall Street back when it was still New Amsterdam I assumed it was called after the Dutch coin.I learn something new every day.
Well…predecessor in time, but not a legal one. The US 1792 Coinage Act (the first coinage act of the newly independent U.S.) specifically says: US Congress creates a dollar to have “ the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current”
How interesting! Thanks for the knowledge!
The original "dollar" came from Bohemia. "Tolar", spelled "thaler" in German, early 16th century. This became "daalder" in Dutch, and "dollar" in English.
The part about Thaler I already knew. Thanks for the reminder tho. I just tried to explain what I was taught.

I read a long time ago that the original symbol was a U and and S superimposed on each other.Eventually the U just became a single line.
Sounds like something of an American explanation for a symbol in use 100 years before America….
The dollar sign was originally for the Spanish Peso, aka the Spanish Dollar or "Piece of Eight" which was the model for the US dollar, and was commonly used as currency in the US both before and after independence.The symbol is generally believed to be a monogram of either "PS" (for "peso") or "PTSI" (for Potosí, the city in Bolivia where the Spanish minted their silver) which over time was simplified into a single or double bar going through an S: $.It's also possible that the design is a symbol for the Pillars of Hercules at Gibraltar, a ribbon wrapping around two pillars, which also appears in the Spanish coat of arms.
The symbol started out as a U on top of an S then they cut the bottom off of the U and it turned into the two lines we now have.edit: Although this was taught to me in school, I now see that the origin of the dollar symbol has become a hugely contentious debate currently dominated by the theory that it was actually taken from a symbol found on spanish pesos that predate its earliest known use in the US(and also that the teacher who taught me that must have been a reader of Ayn Rand as it is her theory from Atlas Shrugged)
The origin of the symbol is still uncertain.  That is one theory but is it not considered to be very likly one.A fundamental problem is that symbol exists with two lines in a 1775 document from Portugal. That is before US deceased independence.  If you look at early US coinage-minded coined in 1792 was defined to have  "the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current".  Foreign currency like the Spanis dollar was legal tender in the US until 1856.  Spanis pesos coin has been called dollars as early as 1581. the origin of the word is 16th-century silver con known as  Joachimsthaler. They re named after the location of the Silver mine in  Joachimsthal which means Sankt Joachims Valley named after Saint Joachim.  So Dollar is the German word thal that means valley with a change in pronunciationHere is a sign or one a lot like it as a symbol for dollars in an English  book printed in 1686 https://archive.org/details/consuetudovellex00maly/page/n791/mode/1upThe symbol have an unknown origin that likely is something in relation to Spanis Persos and the dollar coin, it looks to predate the US as a stateIt might be the case that the US keeps the symbol because of the U over S idea but it would been a new way to look at an existing symbol.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar\_sign#Earlier\_history\_of\_the\_symbol
That is before US deceased independence.We killed it dead.
"Taler" is also a word for big coins in German. You wouldn't call a one or two Euro piece a Taler and no Deutsche Mark coins either, but there are some figures of speech that use the word or fairytales of the Grimm brothers, like "Sterntaler". "Wer den Pfennig nicht ehrt, ist den Taler nicht wert." "Who doesn't honor the penny, doesn't deserve the dollar."Maybe you know this, I just wanted to mention that when a German hears "Taler", the first association is "coin" but the origin is still "valley".
and also that the teacher who taught me that must have been a reader of Ayn Rand as it is her theory from Atlas ShruggedTime to start questioning everything that teacher ever taught you. That's like finding out a waiter pissed in your soup, even though he claims it was only a little piss, and only in one corner of the bowl.
That's the thing about being a little kid. I can't even remember specifically which teacher taught me that. I remember thinking it was neat (internalizing it) and putting that symbol on a worksheet that I turned in then showing her afterward and her being like "if I had noticed you put the U there, I would have marked it wrong since that's not the symbol anymore" but I still can't put the specific teacher's face to that exchange. I would bet sixth grade though, that teacher is the most likely suspect.
Yes, I had heard that it was based on a 'U' superimposed on an 'S'.  I think another theory that's now gaining some credibility, is that it is based on the El family insignia.
American schools really are badly disguised propaganda mills aren't they?
Which country has schools that teach only Universally Approved Truth tm?
Not even disguised.Go back and read the arguments against compulsory education at the turn of the last century. It was very deliberately modeled on the German Imperial Model, which had as a primary goal to make good Citizens.  It was extremely controversial.
I thought this was the reason as well. I was also a former Ayn Rand reader.
Just a friendly reminder for everyone to remember to dot your i’s, cross your t’s, and s your d’s
Hey buddy, mind your p’s and q’sI don’t want your p in my q.
I remember when I was a kid (80s) I read somewhere (or was told) that the $ which sometimes has two vertical lines in it originally had a U instead of two vertical lines.  So, U and S superimposed.  Of course, I believed this for a long time because it sounds totally plausible.But it's wrong, as the posters above will attest.  I wonder where I first heard that and if anyone else had.
It’s undetermined; it may be that the old symbol was chosen because it also worked as a form of US
I'm pretty sure I saw it written with two lines as well but that might be a Mandela effect since the ASCII character has always had one line and I grew up in the age of computers.
My 80's kid memory, which may or may not be right, was that $ officially had two vertical lines but started having 1 in the age of typewriters since the symbol was generated by typing an S, backspacing, and typing a vertical line, '|' in the same space.
The leading theory is its a combination of a U and S, particularly the version with two lines.The term "bucks" comes from trading deer pelts as currency (male deer being bucks)
The leading theory is its a combination of a U and SNot at all. Not only is not "the leading theory", it has been proven false.
It's not an S, it's an $.  Though current fonts tend to show a single vertical line across the S, there used to be two.  And the two vertical lines used to be connected at the bottom, sorta like a U.  So the real symbol started out as a U written over and S for US.
This is just a baseless theory, not a fact. Considering the $ symbol has existed for a LOT longer than the United States, the theory holds literally no water - just like a U with a chopped off bottom.
Nope.
Nope.

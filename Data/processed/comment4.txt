It’s called Lords of War, with Bill Skarsgård playing his son:Yuri Orlov, the world's most famous arms dealer, discovers that he has a son, Anton who is trying to outdo his father by raising an army of mercenaries to fight in America's Middle Eastern conflicts, triggering a father-son rivalry.
Okay, so Yuri's gonna kill his son, right?
Of course… we know what happened to Jared…
Without Jared what’s the point
Coked out Jared was definitely the point.
Is it gonna include a sequence where Nick Cage is prisoner swapped for a basketball player?
If they overlook that entire situation for this movie just to make it even more fictionalized I wouldn’t be surprised. They’re trying to promote this as Nic Cage as the good guy, and they’ll have to separate his movie character from the real Viktor Bout somehow.
Oh dear God no lol
This feels like and Alien/Aliens or Rambo/Rambo II type of thing where the first film is rather serious and tragic while the sequel wil be completely different in tone.
Bill Skateboard as Nic Cage's son though is pretty great casting, imo.
Bill Skarsgård playing his son.So is he just gonna play his John Wick character again? Pass
Nothing we have heard indicates he will have a false accent. So why bother with a pass?
As decent a film as it was, the thing from Lord of War that always stuck with me was the Amnesty International ad that came with it, where they presented a mock QVC-like segment selling AK-47’s, talking up that they’re so easy to use, your child soldiers can use them.Edit: I am aware of how easy AK-47s are to use. The point of it being mentioned in the fake shopping channel segment was to say they’re so easy to use, they’re given to child soldiers, as a way of talking about how awful the use of child soldiers is. Whether the gun is good or not is not the important part. Here’s the clip: https://youtu.be/e7794T4SvAw?si=LTaIJ3n9NAeksZl6
My favorite piece of trivia from this movie is that they used a real stockpile of over 3,000 AK-47s because it was cheaper than obtaining prop guns.
Similarly with those tanks…
Except they didn’t use ak47s, they used vz58s that look similar to AKs but are 100% distinct in every part except use the same round. They were just cheaper at the time(not anymore). They don’t even share the same operating system or magazine
Do you have a source for this? I’ve seen it mentioned on Reddit on TIL several times but nobody ever links a source. They link Wikipedia which states that AK-47s are used in the movie. The director of the film states that it’s AK-47s in an interview here:https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/director-finds-real-guns-cheaper-than-props/46QMNCH3JD3MGQQ3ABR4G3VOMQ/And in another interview here:https://www.npr.org/2005/09/16/4851189/lord-of-war-an-arms-dealer-as-heroEvery site that mentions VZ58 cites Wikipedia which never actually claims this. The director of the film also had said multiple times that they were Kalishnikovs.
Well it’s pretty obvious when you see the racks of guns. The biggest tell it’s the fin on the magazine you can clearly see it during the armory walk through scene. Also you can clearly tell by the stocks have a much more sweeping curve to them to the traditional more angular/triangular shape of the akm stocks. They use milled Ak’s for some of the scenes you like the close up on Nick Cage and intro scene.
Well akshully…
I know you’re making a joke but it’s a noticeable distinction.
Complete accuracy of technical gun knowledge is not the point of Lord of War. It seems to be a pattern that people who pride themselves on technical gun knowledge often lose the forest for the trees.
Well no, cause the guy I responded to provided a trivia fact and I’m showing that his little bit of trivia is incorrect. We aren’t talking about the actual substance of the movie, it’s literally a bit of movie trivia. You’re taking this a bit too seriously
An AK-47 is a pretty easy to use rifle … and they’re cheap and are almost impossible to jam.They may not be super accurate over distance but it’s been one of the most dependable weapons in war on multiple continents for the better part of a century.
The amount of people missing the point... wow.
anyone can pull a trigger man, this is true for most guns, its not rocket science to show-and-tell a child where the mag release is or a safety
I think the bigger point is that they are reliable as fuck and because of that, you can put them in a kid's hands and trust that it won't be a problem.I'm going straight to hell by saying this, but I'd venture a guess that the kid is going to go before the gun will.
True the kid and gun can be face down in the mud then the next one can pick it up and keep on shooting.
It was a commentary on child soldiers not an actual sales pitch lol
The ease of use was used as a way to talk about how they’re given to child soldiers. “So simple, a child could use it, and they do”.
They require less maintenance than other guns.
I really really hope they hire back Antonio Pinto to produce the soundtrack.The first soundtrack is beautiful and chilling at the same rims. Still have it on rotation and listen to it regularly.
The AK-47 was designed to be given to an illiterate half trained soviet peasant from the steppes. It really is so easy a child can use it. Not well, but well enough. It is the finest weapon in the world in that context. When humans live amoung the stars we will still be killing each other with AK-47s.
Forget to clean it? No problem, works fine.Drop in water, sand? Give it a shake, works fine.Manage to break it? No problem, grab another from the pile.
This one?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7794T4SvAw
That’s the one
I’ll be the one to say it, did we really need a sequel to this?
I don't think anyone in the world asked for this. Still gonna watch it though.
Same. I am a sucker for Cage movies. He never fails to entertain no matter how dumb the premise of the movie is.
Jiu Jitsu was absurd and he was hilarious in it
[deleted]
Before I even checked, I was certain that Jenna Ortega would be a cast member in this…
we need National Treasure 3.
Considering his cage-aissance I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.
I think we got the Disney+ series instead, which I did not watch
Pretty sure most people who might be interested in a National Treasure series checked out as soon as Disney made it clear Cage wouldn’t be in it.
I made it to an episode where they had to break into Elvis' secret room in Graceland for some reason.  After that episode I just stopped watching.  It wasn't like it was super awful and unwatchable.  It was just clear they were going for a new, younger audience and it just wasn't the National Treasure show that I wanted.
I freakin love the National Treasure movies. I always think I'll turn the first one on for background noise bit then I can't look away lol.
This one will document how we traded him for Brittney Griner /s
Putin fleeced us fr fr
Couldn't even get any draft picks in the deal!
Yeah sure, he's probably back at his game after everybody knows who he was, and the world moved on from him.
Worst trade since the Red Sox gave the Yankees Babe Ruth
No, but geopolitics has given Hollywood too much material to not do a sequel
Hollywood ain’t gonna follow geopolitics at all. They would never dream of having a villain that wasn’t the US government or the U.S. military.
You should watch some movies
What are some political movies that came out in the past decade where the villain isn’t the United States government or a U.S. corporation?Name one movie where the villain is the Chinese government. No indie films. Major big budget releases only.
Top Gun II: Maverick
Name a movie where US army is the enemy.
Literally any movie about Vietnam post The Green Berets. Any movie about the Iraq War that isn’t American Sniper. Even the only movie about the Gulf War, Jarhead is pretty explicit in its criticisms.
The Covenant, 12 Strong, The Outpost
I like how you said the villain is always the US Government or Military and then threw in US Corporations which would imply they're an arm of the US Government, a situation which would in fact make them villains. I doubt it was meant as clever commentary which makes it even more ironic.
I’m sorry…what?
Need?  Do we need any movie?I liked the original.  If this is as good, sounds worth it to me
The guy it was based on has been traded back to Russia
20 years after the first one?  Unplanned sequels are iffy anyway, but if it's not within 5 years of the original, the chances of it being anything more than a money grab are likely low.  Is there really another story to tell?  I think the movie made the point it wanted to make.
Probably not but I don’t think its as offensively egregious as Gladiator 2.
I’m hyped for gladiator 2..it’s unnecessary but the cast is lit as fuck
I did. I need four things for survival: air, water, food and a Lord of War sequel. Got it?
If it's good then it doesn't matter.Also, did we really need any movie? This response to sequel/reboot news always upsets me in its close-mindedness. You can make a great, original film out of anything.
We didn’t. Especially because in real life the US tossed Viktor Bout in jail and then Russia decided to kidnap athletes to get him released. From the description it sounds like they are going to have his son found blackwater or some shit, which again, should end with the U.S. cancelling his business after Nissour square but in the movie probably won’t since that’s too anti climatic.
Or a Wagner equivalent, if they want to keep the "Russia traded for him" angle.
I hope it ends with Skarsgard finding a primed handgrenade in a package in his private jet.
Which would make sense, but some Hollywood exec will say it’s too complicated for American audiences so they won’t do it.
Maybe 10 years ago it could've worked, now it just feels...random?
The real-life arms dealer the movie was based on was released from prison a couple years ago, I assume that's the reason for the timing. Still feels super unnecessary.
I can't decide if I'm disappointed or excited. I'll watch it either way.
Maybe it's related to Britney Griner...?
It’s going to be even more appropriate now with victor bout walking free. Doesn’t make it all right though. Also going to be even more fictionalized since we haven’t had 20 years of mythology about Ukraine.The “American conflicts abroad” thing means he’s selling to Isis? I’m intrigued anyway.
well, the person who the movie is based on is still alive and active.
Is it gonna include a sequence where Nick Cage is prisoner swapped for a basketball player?
Seems like a fair trade to me. Nothing sus at all.
Is that you, Viktor?
yeah great trade, my bets are on Griner in a 1 on 1, she's a much better basketball player than Bout
You know how there are things they can't do in movies because they seem unrealistic, even if they actually happened? If there is an exchange in the movie, I bet he will be exchanged for a captured spy because that seems more plausible.
I really really hope they hire back Antonio Pinto to produce the soundtrack. The first soundtrack is beautiful and chilling at the same rims. Still have it on rotation and listen to it regularly.
I prefer "War Lord". /s
War Lord of War, the Lord of Wars
Does it begin with him being released from prison in exchange for a US athlete?
What a great story and character.  One of his best movies.
Lord of War was/is my favorite movie. This is exciting news.
Same, I'm really exciting to see what piqued Cage to do this sequel. I think it's gonna be awesome and highlight some more unconfirmed truths about modern day arms/wars.
Lord of war was goood. Damn this is a unexpected good surprise.
I don't know how to feel about this. The first movie was stellar, does it really need a sequel?
Are you suggesting we should only make sequels to shitty movies? I don't follow the logic
I think the sentiment is that the first one is a great stand-alone movie, and that pushing a contrived sequel 20 years later poses the risk of hurting the legacy of the original.
I'm not going to watch it. I love Lord of War, it doesn't need a sequel.
What if the ratings are good? Still won’t watch it?
Unless it's a legit masterpiece that enhances the original I don't really see a reason to.
But why?
Answer: https://youtu.be/St8iEpkcDJc?si=9A\_34PyFvufwv0mU&t=5
Was expecting money.mrkrabs, that works too.
Hollywood- “why aren’t people going to theaters like they used to?”
As bad as it will likely be, will still be better than most super hero movies lately that are drowning the theaters
Can’t stand Nicolas cage or anything he’s been in but credit where credit is due, lord of war was an incredible movie.
No one ever wants or needs a Nic Cage fix. But when you get one you’re like “Yeah OK, that was nice. Seconds? No thank you, I’ve had just enough.”
Wrong. I don’t think there will ever be enough nic cage to get my fix…
I don't understand how people still find his movies worthwhile. He does the same thing over and over.
His movie selection might not be the best one around but he has some really good movies too and this one is one of them.
If Johnny Blaze doesn’t appear in a fiery suit this time, there’s no point.
Absolutely LOVE the movie. Didn’t really think it needed a sequel
I hope the sequel requires them to do something wild like they did in the first film where they bought 3,000 AKs because it was cheaper than renting them.Also, for anyone wanting to read a wild story about international arms dealers, check out Outlaws, Inc, by Matt Potter. He also wrote Fuck You and Goodbye: A History of the Resignation Letter (although his publisher made him change the title).
Why?
Interesting. I wonder to what degree the Bout-Griner swap will be used.
Martin Blank, please.
Now all I need is that third national treasure installment 🤞
I like his new full hair-do
Lord of War 2: Ragnarok
The 👑 returns! 🦾
That was a great movie that really doesn't need a sequel. Please stop doing this, Hollywood.
